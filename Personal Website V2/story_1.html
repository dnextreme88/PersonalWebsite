				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>I want to be an aspiring writer someday. This is my 1st fictional story. The personal project was initially started on September 23, 2012 and was finished on March 26, 2014. The story is inspired by Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, who revolves around the story of the main protagonist to do what is right whilst upholding his honor. Head forward to read my content. Hope you drop a feedback!</p>
			<!-- Synopsis section -->
				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
					<p>Raz is fresh of the boat as a new addition to the secret organization called SOLDIER. A quiet and persevering man, the story follows his journey in his conquest to rid of the renegade group headed by former SOLDIER operative, Jeffrey. Jeffrey had gathered a large upscale forces that have terrorized the lands of Thalts.</p>

					<p>SOLDIER (Special Operating Law Defensive Investigators Executing Renegades) is a secret task force whose main goal is to eliminate inhumanity in the land. SOLDIER is headed by Biggs, whose skills in the military and fervent training in battlegrounds made him a powerful yet kind-hearted leader. SOLDIER operates privately and does not take orders from the government. They have no working relationship from other private agencies by the government either. Recruitment is voluntary and is usually through invites only. SOLDIER is composed of many groups. These groups are utilized in special missions when trouble is present.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, SOLDIER were not aware that Jeffrey is behind this. As a secret organization that has no direct relationship with other government agencies, SOLDIER marches forward in dealing with hostile units themselves without the help of military agencies to aid them.</p>

					<p>Through the ups and downs of his quest, Raz will find someone who will understand his woes as they conquer over injustice and bring back the old glory of the land.</p>
