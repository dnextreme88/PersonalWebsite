			<h2 style="color: #B20000;">Chapter 11A1: Get Away Safely</h2>
				<p><i>You picked Vengeance Line. Your decision will affect how the characters will act towards you.</i></p>
				<p id="content">
					Raz decided not to help Nicole and her forces. His small wings grew again as he looks at himself. He immediately flew over the skyline and left them. Nicole geared her sight at Raz for his betrayal. This greatly severed his relationship with SOLDIER. </p>
				<p id="content">
					Raz flew freely like a bird out of the cage. A smug expression ran down his face. He betrayed SOLDIER. Something that they were totally surprised of. As Raz was travelling, Jeffrey dashed in front of him. He seems happy again.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Wow you have wings, Raz. Your body structures has mutated.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed as he looked at Raz's wings. <br />
					"<i>I... don't know how this happened. I just had this when you captured me in Karuhat village.</i>" Raz said as he showed his wings to Jeffrey. <br />
					"<i>You have been afflicted with the virus.</i>" Jeffrey remarked. <br />
					"<i>How did that happen? I was highly resistant to your viruses.</i>" Raz defended. <br />
					"<i>You fought so many battles. You have shed lives and destroyed your foes. Can't you possibly imagine that the virus stucked into you as you were fighting? You just didn't realize it. Even though you have the blood of SOLDIER, the virus won't resist you. You're vulnerable.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed. <br />
					"<i>I didn't think it would happen this way...</i>" Raz surprised of himself.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Jeffrey didn't say a word. Instead, they just head to his HQ. On the HQ, Raz immediately take notice at the monsters. He was nearly attacked by a bandit but Jeffrey stopped him. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>He was a test sample! How could you possibly -</i>" A bandit knight surprised of Raz. <br />
					"<i>Calm down. He got away safely, I know. However for betraying SOLDIER, it means good. It's valuable to have someone who knows how SOLDIER moves. We will use him valuably.</i>" Jeffrey said as he tried to improve the mood of the bandit. <br />
					"<i>He can't be trusted! That's a spy!</i>" The bandit knight being stubborn. <br />
					"<i>We shall see if that's the case. For now, he is of big help.</i>" Jeffrey said.
					</div>
				<p id="content">
					The bandit knight seemed jealous. He was furious for the fact that he doesn't like the appearance of a former SOLDIER operative in the place. He immediately approached Almon, one of Jeffrey's leaders about it. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>I don't like the presence of this new guy. What do you think?</i>" The bandit knight went to Almon for his concern. <br />
					"<i>I don't, either. He is unwelcomed. We captured this guy along with the woman a couple of days ago.</i>" Almon said as he was sharpening his blade. <br />
					"<i>Then he must be killed! What is a SOLDIER operative doing here anyway?</i>" The bandit knight insists. <br />
					"<i>Pfft, let it be. I shall convince Jeffrey to change his mind.</i>" Almon suggested.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Almon approached Jeffrey about the issue. Jeffrey was on his office. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Jeffrey, why did you bring a SOLDIER operative here? That's insanity!</i>" Almon complained. <br />
					"<i>Calm down, Almon. Don't worry, you will kill Raz after you destroy his former members at the mission.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed. <br />
					"<i>I will!? Sounds great!</i>" Almon sounding happy after the statement. <br />
					"<i>That means that you will both be on the same group. My orders are to neutralize the SOLDIER members first then once the dust has settled, you will go after Raz unexpectedly.</i>" Jeffrey commanded. <br />
					"<i>Will do. Where will we head?</i>" Almon asked. <br />
					"<i>You'll go to the outskirts of Navang. I heard that a SOLDIER group called Omega Team patrols the area. Then you'll head to Navang Proper and destroy the rest. Afterwards, you'll do what I said. Understood?</i>" Jeffrey commanded as he took of his cape. <br />
					"<i>Alright.</i>" Almon affirmed. <br />
					"<i>I want him dead, you hear me? If you don't, then I will kill you.</i>" Jeffrey insisted.
