			<h2>Chapter 1: A New Beginning</h2>
				<p id="content">
					The story opens up in a dense village called Karuhat. A village shimmering with its simple beauty, the village boasts one of the densest areas outside the grand city of Thalts. Houses built on bricks and stones, brown wooden roofs like that of the good, ol' country-style houses meant for the middle-class people. People come and go, travelling to different villages to barter and earn for a living. On the center of the village is a huge fountain where people of all ages come to enjoy the view of a spectacular splash of water coming down from the stream. At night, it's a magnificent view as it displays a lot of swirly movements.</p>
				<p id="content">
					On one corner of the benches, Aaron watches Raz hone his melee skills on a private yard. Raz is a fresh face of SOLDIER, a secret task force who functions like that of the government's military but are more experienced. He swung his sword swiftly and with grace as he hits a hard, wooden mannequin.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Come on, Raz. Swing harder and faster!</i>" Aaron shouts with grace as he encourages Raz. <br />
					"<i>Right! I'm making myself a better operative. You'll never know when I'd have a mission already. So better come prepared!</i>" Raz replies back as he continues to swing at the mannequin. <br />
					"<i>All these assignments and no real missions is dull. It's like they're hanging me to dry.</i>" Raz further adds. <br />
					"<i>It'll just be a matter of time before they give it to you. They'll probably need you to show off more skills.</i>" Aaron said as he continually looks at Raz. Raz briefly stops for a moment and looks back. <br />
					"<i>I mean, they haven't seen you at your best yet! Raz will soon be better than Aaron. Soon.</i>" Aaron adds as he noticed Raz with a serious expression. <br />
					"<i>Oh. You're joking aren't you, Aaron? I'm still yet to meet the leader of SOLDIER. So I do that and maybe I'll take your word for it.</i>" Raz replied as he drops his sword and talked to Aaron. <br />
					"<i>Hahaha! With those swifty swings, you'll become one of the best operatives SOLDIER ever had. No joke!</i>" Aaron laughing hard. He deeply motivated Raz.

					A ringtone was eventually heard from Aaron's phone. It was from Zey. He got it out and Raz continued to practice.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Aaron, this is Zey. You and Raz need to come to HQ. Biggs want to see you. Over.</i>" Zey said over the phone as he summons the two operatives. Aaron was tingled with the secretary's voice. <br />
					"<i>Aaron speaking. Yes, we'll be there in about an hour. Over.</i>" Aaron answered back, trying not to blush. Aaron then called Raz. <br />
					"<i>Hey, Raz. Zey needs us at HQ. We better get going.</i>" Aaron told Raz. <br />
					"<i>For what reason?</i>" Raz asked. <br />
					"<i>The boss needs us. You'll get to meet the boss now.</i>" Aaron firmly said. <br />
					"<i>For real!? Ok let's go!</i>" Raz excitedly exclaimed as he immediately packed up his things and then went to HQ.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz and Aaron made it to HQ. He's still amazed by the huge building. High-end technology amazed this young upstart. They went up through the elevator going to the 9th floor, where Biggs' office resides. Raz was so excited that he gets to finally meet Biggs for the first time. Upon reaching the floor, they went to Zey's office, Biggs' secretary. She is an elegant woman who is more on wits than jokes. This woman takes her job really well.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Hey there, gentlemen. Good to see you back at HQ. Biggs need you both.</i>" Zey welcomed both of them as they stumble upon her office. Aaron gets the tingles again. Raz was just cool. <br />
					"<i>Hi, Zey. I'm excited to meet Biggs. It's gotta be special!</i>" Raz exclaimed with such passion. <br />
					"<i>You know it'll be surprising when its Biggs who says it. Can't spoil you, Raz. He'll tell you about that himself.</i>" Zey calmly replied as she holds her files and documents and went back to her seat. <br />
					"<i>Ok, Zey. We'll head there now.</i>" Aaron replied as he keeps his stare at Zey. They eventually went to Biggs' office. <br />
					"<i>There you are! Raz, it's good to finally meet face-to-face. I'm Biggs, the forerunner of SOLDIER. Pleasure to finally see you.</i>" Biggs greeted both men with such delight. He was overwhelmed by finally seeing Raz. <br />
					"<i>Sir! Pleasure to meet you. I'm thankful for the opportunity to see you for the first time.</i>" Raz happily exclaimed. Biggs' tone changed. <br />
					"<i>On to the more serious talk. Lately, we have lost the leader of Beta Team, Jeffrey. We had no whereabouts of him since then. Raz, you'll have your first, real mission. You need to go and investigate -</i>" Biggs with a different tone. Raz interrupted him. <br />
					"<i>Really!? I have my first real mission! It finally happened!</i>" Raz surprised of Biggs' statement. <br />
					"<i>Yes. I've already dispatched additional staff to investigate on Jeffrey's matter but we've lost contact too.</i>" Biggs replied as he puts his palm in his face, impying disappointment. <br />
					"<i>This also means one thing. You'll be the new leader of Beta Team. Aaron, you and Raz's new team will team-up to investigate a small village. It's being invaded. Don't falter!</i>" Biggs added as he roams in circles whilst looking at his window. Aaron nods in confirmation. <br />
					"<i>Yes sir! We'll make good.</i>" Aaron replied as he and Raz salutes Biggs. <br />
					"<i>I know you will. You may now leave the room and prepare for the mission. Biggs out.</i>" Biggs ended as he salutes both operatives. Aaron and Raz prepare to exit the office. They went on with the mission.
