			<h2>Chapter 8: The Secret Operative</h2>
				<p id="content">
					At HQ, Biggs received a phone call. He finished drinking his coffee and a yogurt then grabbed the phone. He was astounded by the voice. It seems unfamiliar.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Hello. This is Biggs, leader of the group SOLDIER. What can I do for you?</i>" Biggs answered the phone. He finished his yogurt as well. <br />
					"<i>Hi. I would like to come to your HQ. We'll discuss some matters on hand. It'll be quick, don't worry.</i>" The woman said in a rushing voice. <br />
					"<i>For what?</i>" Biggs quickly asked. <br />
					"<i>You'll soon know. Can't talk much right now. I'm wounded. I'll see ya.</i>" The woman said as she starts to bring the phone down. <br />
					"<i>Huh? Hey, wai -</i>" Biggs in mid-sentence. The woman immediately hung up the phone.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Biggs wondered who that person was. Biggs continued to drink another coffee. He looks at his files again while waiting for the arrival of the woman. Eventually, the woman arrived at the HQ gates. Biggs immediately looked at his control panels to see who it was. He saw a woman. He immediately got up from his couch and went to the front gates. He opens the gate and there stumbled a pretty woman wearing shades in front of him.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Hi there, ma'am. You look very unfamiliar. What brings you here?</i>" Biggs greeting the woman as he looks at her from head-to-toe. <br />
					"<i>Hello, sir. May I convene a short meeting with you? There's something you need to know.</i>" The woman responded.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					The woman immediately removed her brown-clad shades. She waggled her short shoulder-length hair as it moves freely by the wind. She wears a long brown coat, black slacks and boots matched with gray tops. She has a pouty, red lips, her nose so firm, her ears upright. Her green eyes are oozing beauty like that of a gemstone. Her eyebrows so seductive and curvy. She carries with her a submachine gun in hand.</p>
				<p id="content">
					Biggs was shunned by such beauty in front of him. He immediately recognized that it was Nicole, a secret operative who recently joined SOLDIER to fight the bioterrorists off. She specializes in quick and fast movements. She is as equally as fast and versatile as the men in SOLDIER is. Her main weaponry is a submachine gun for it is efficient in taking out targets in quick fashion. They went to the office to discuss what Nicole asked for. They immediately sit upon the couch Biggs was seating a while ago. There, Nicole discussed plans on counter-attacking the bioterrorists.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>SOLDIER is having difficulties lately, sir. The bioterrorists keep respawning.</i>" Nicole said as she puts back her shades on. Biggs looked at her astounding beauty slowly. <br />
					"<i>I've been attacked in the city that's why I got these wounds. There must be a way to stop them.</i>" Nicole further added as she showed her wounds to Biggs. <br />
					"<i>I see. You must be treated. I believe you're talking about the pods? The pods make the bioterrorists respawn as they continue to clone people.</i>" Biggs responded. <br />
					"<i>So we'll have to destroy those? They have been attacking Ilang village lately.</i>" Nicole reported. <br />
					"<i>That's because a pod exists there. They seem intent on reclaiming it back and we can't allow that. I'll send Zeta Team to defend the area.</i>" Biggs ordering an issue. <br />
					"<i>Okay. I'll head to Karuhat village for that investigation you've assigned us a couple of weeks ago.</i>" Nicole said as she stood up and starts to leave. <br />
					"<i>That's good. Take care, Nicole.</i>" Biggs said as he sat up and accompany Nicole leave.
