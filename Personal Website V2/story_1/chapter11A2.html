			<h2 style="color: #B20000;">Chapter 11A2: A Fight For Destiny</h2>
				<p id="content">
					Almon and Raz heads to the outskirts of Navang, as directed by Jeffrey. A heavily guarded city, Navang boasts some of the highest buildings and a place with a lot of hideouts. It has good water reservoir that helps the city maintain its cleanliness. A huge fountain is its center of attraction. People also enjoy the expensive parks and recreational areas that the city has to offer. It was a beautiful getaway place that a tourist can enjoy. </p>
				<p id="content">
					Meanwhile, Omega Team patrols the prized area. It is spearheaded by Drix, a huge guy who has knacks for battle and is very supportive. Almon devised a plan for an infiltration. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Navang is a heavily guarded city. There's only a few of us. We won't be able to destroy them.</i>" Raz shouted. <br />
					"<i>Tss. You're a former SOLDIER operative, right? You should be the one planning this all out.</i>" Almon replied. <br />
					"<i>Yeah. Leave it to him!</i>" The bandit knight added. <br />
					"<i>Fine. Navang has a second entrance entering the city. From what I remember, that entrance is easy-picking. Patrol guards are not abundant there. We can infiltrate the area by knocking a tower down that will destroy an outpost, giving us ample opportunity for another preemptive strike as they appear from the smoke.</i>" Raz said as he points at Navang. <br />
					"<i>How are you sure we will be successful?</i>" Almon asked. <br />
					"<i>We will. It destroys an outpost. It won't do much alarm on the patrols.</i>" Raz replied. <br />
					"<i>I suggest we strike the front entrance. We will surprise them there rather than entering through the second entrance which is quite far for us to travel.</i>" The bandit knight insisted as he circles the group. <br />
					"<i>It's more dangerous when we strike the front. Omega Team is decked at the city. There are more patrols over there, unless we take the risk.</i>" Raz insisted in return. <br />
					"<i>Bah. We will leave a smoke grenade, wait for them to appear and fire poison bolts to kill them. That shall alert their presence.</i>" Almon as he went with Raz's plan.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					The Bandit Knight disapproved and was enraged so he took with him half of his forces while the other half went with the other two. Almon and Raz's forces went around the back and waited for the Knight's signal. When the signal was issued, both group threw a smoke grenade in front of their respective gates and fired a shot. The patrols were alerted by their presence. Their plan went. Patrolling SOLDIER operatives appeared at the smokes and the rebel groups fired poison bolts and killed them in quick fashion. They immediately infiltrated the city. </p>
				<p id="content">
					The Bandit Knight's forces rushed the gate. With fury, he slays SOLDIER operatives that stood his way. His group focused on the stationed outposts. He was able to clear out the front buildings. When they reached the fountain, Drix's elite men guards the area. They rushed forward however there were backups from side-to-side. His monsters were easily wiped out. Without nowhere to go, the Bandit Knight tried to surrender however Drix killed him. </p>
				<p id="content">
					On the other hand, Raz and Almon's forces had more ranged supports and were able to clear their front quicker. Ambushes were everywhere but Raz slays each of his former mates as they come. An enraged Raz fumes with fury that he killed them so fast. Almon's forces were also successful in dealing with the other ambushing group. When that's done, they headed to the fountain to confront Drix's men. A surprised Drix saw Raz drenched in the opposite side. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Raz!? Is that you!? How could you do this?</i>" Drix was surprised of Raz's betrayal.<br />
					"<i>This is me. I lost myself. I have gone to destroy the things I love. There is nothing left to lose. Everything will come to an end!</i>" Raz replied in a soft voice. <br />
					"<i>I can't believe you would side with Jeffrey! You have lost your honor!</i>" Drix shouted angrily. <br />
					"<i>I have lost it and vengeance is all that runs here. SOLDIER has betrayed me! Now, you will pay!</i>" Raz insisted. <br />
					"<i>You lost your mind. You don't know what you're saying! Wake up, get back into the reality!</i>" Drix still shouting as he convinces Raz. <br />
					"<i>SOLDIER has taken many lives. I have come to avenge those loses. I shouldn't have trusted you in the first place. You will die here!</i>" Raz said as he slowly points at Drix. <br />
					"<i>Then I wasted my time putting some sense into you.</i>" Drix ended as he drew his blade.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Drix rushed forward as Raz waited for him to come closer. Raz drew his sword and was able to drove him back. Raz told Almon to focus on Drix's men while he focuses on Drix himself. Raz slashes his former mates in fury. There is indeed no mercy shown by Raz. Almon's forces destroys the other half. Ambushes still occurred, as reinforcements started to come in. Eventually, the remaining forces of the slain Bandit Knight joined the fray. A huge melee ensued the fight for survival. Afterwards, it came to the point where it was only Raz, Almon and some of Drix's elite remain standing. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Raz. you don't wanna make me do this! You left Nicole's forces out there to fend these monsters and now you'll side with them? What mockery is this?</i>" Drix said angrily as he slowly puts down his blade and looks at his wounds. <br />
					"<i>Drix, they could take care of themselves. There's no need to worry. You're too supportive. You're too worried. SOLDIER should get rid of you.</i>" Raz exclaimed as he calms Drix. <br />
					"<i>Why wouldn't I be worried? We helped remove these monsters here but you're here to support and grow them in numbers! You think I wouldn't care for that?</i>" Drix still fuming mad. <br />
					"<i>You don't have to care for that because I will be slaying you.</i>" Raz said while Almon prepares his gun and Drix looks at them with hatred. <br />
					"<i>We'll see about that.</i>" Drix ended as he puts up his blade again.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz and Almon killed his remaining forces. Drix was left to fend for himself. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Finish me, for I deserve a clean death!</i>" Drix exclaimed in his dying breath. <br />
					"<i>Like I said awhile ago, you shouldn't care anymore. You'll die and be gone!</i>" Raz ended while Almon carefully stalks Raz from behind.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz slew him. He's finished and looked upon Drix with anguish but it was halted immediately for he turned his back immediately for he sensed something strange. Almon attempted to rush and pierce Raz from the back but he managed to dodge it. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Hmm. You think you'll betray me as well?</i>" Raz said as he holds Almon's long dagger with immense force. <br />
					"<i>Our mission isn't done yet. I was tasked to kill you. You don't belong anywhere!</i>" Almon replied as he attempts to grab his dagger from the clutches of Raz. <br />
					"<i>Betrayal? Then make your move and we shall see who'll be the last man standing.</i>" Raz broke free of his dagger.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Another duel commenced. Raz's wings grew at his back again. Raz dodged the sharp edge with swift precision. Raz lunged forward but Almon dodged as well. He went for a jump but was counter-attacked. Almon pierced forward but Raz made a side step, only hitting his wings. He was able to stun Almon and deliver a huge right uppercut to the back that sent him to the canvas. He got up and was furious. He was punched hard that he got stucked in the wall. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Any last words?</i>" Raz exclaimed as he immediately rushed at the weakened Almon. <br />
					"<i>No! Don't kill me, Raz! I can be of help! I won't tell Jeffrey about this as long as you let me live!</i>" Almon screamed out loud as he becomes extremely scared and nervous. <br />
					"<i>You're petty excuses and how that Bandit Knight treated me was foolish. You also deserve to die and be gone!</i>" Raz said firmly. <br />
					"<i>No, it can't be!</i>" Almon screamed.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
						Raz dealt his final blow and pierced him forward. Almon was killed and dropped down heavily to the canvas. He was done. </p>
