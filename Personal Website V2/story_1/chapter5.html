			<h2>Chapter 5: The Sad News</h2>
				<p id="content">
					Beta Team returned to HQ with unfortunate news. Alpha Team's loss was a big failure on their part. They were ambushed and had to kill them. Other than that, Raz felt guilty as he wasn't able to protect some of his men when they retreated. He also lost a good friend. It's a rough day for him. He approached Biggs with sadness painted in his face, bringing the bad news.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Raz, where's Alpha Team? What happened?</i>" Biggs hurriedly asks. <br />
					"<i>Sir, Alpha Team was wiped out during the ambush. We killed them. We had no choice because they were infected.</i>" Raz said in a guilty tone. <br />
					"<i>Damn! We lost another team. How could this be? That was a simple task, Raz. We can't lose more men.</i>" An angry Biggs shouts. He slammed his fists onto his desk. Some of his files flew due to such immense force. <br />
					"<i>Sir, we deeply apologize. They weren't regular terrorists we were used to fighting. Those are bio-terrorists, a mutation of humans bent on increasing their number through their poison-tipped bullets. Alpha Team was -</i>" Raz explained as he is interrupted by Biggs. <br />
					"<i>Alpha Team!? How could this be!?</i>" Biggs said seeming as he don't know what to do. <br />
					"<i>They were all infected, including Aaron, into monsters and they were primed to kill the rest of us.</i>" Raz said. <br />
					"<i>Aaron's dead? This ain't good. Did you kill all of them? How about the villagers?</i>" Biggs asking more questions. <br />
					"<i>No. We were outnumbered, sir. There was too many of them for us to handle. The villagers, they were the bio-terrorists. They were disguised, we never knew it until Alpha Team reported it to us. The villagers got infected and they infected Alpha Team, causing us no choice but to kill Aaron and his men in the struggle for survival.</i>" Raz said. <br />
					"<i>This is another sad news for SOLDIER. We'll be... getting back there soon. I didn't like what I heard, Raz. I want this to get settled soon. You may leave.</i>" Biggs said as he let Raz out of his office. Biggs sat down on his chair with a displeasing face. He didn't know what to do.

					Raz was in such despair right now after the tragic fate of Alpha Team at Karuhat village. Zey overheard the conversation of the two. She approached Raz from behind as he exited Biggs' office.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Raz?</i>" Zey catching up to Raz. Raz turned back. <br />
					"<i>Yes, Zey?"</i>" Raz asked. <br />
					"<i>I heard of Aaron's death. I... grieve for his loss too. I shouldn't have made him look like a fool to me. My bad.</i>" A guilty Zey said. She seemed to have feelings for Aaron too. Yet it was too late. <br />
					"<i>Well. He's gone now, Zey. It's a huge loss for my part. He's a good friend of mine. We just never had it coming.</i>" Raz exclaimed. He looks on to Zey as she taps his shoulder for encouragement. <br />
					"<i>I know. Sad things do happen. But life has to go on.</i>" Zey exclaimed. She continues to encourage Raz despite the sadness.

				<p id="content">
					Raz didn't reply anymore. He went to the HQ's training grounds, that is overlooking a weapon's facility nearby. He stayed by the rails as he looked down to reminisce the good moments with a slain ally, most importantly, a friend. Dismayed for such a turn of events, he went on his way. Truly, there's no time to grieve. He decided to head to Karuhat village at night. There is a price to pay. As for Zey, she went back to her office to continue her work.</p>
