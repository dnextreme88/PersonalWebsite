			<h2>Chapter 17: The Fall Of SOLDIER</h2>
				<p id="content">
					Meanwhile, SOLDIER HQ is on red alert. They tightened securities for they have realized a spy infiltrated their facilities and disabled some security measures SOLDIER puts in place. Now, they have to face a horde of monsters and bioterrorists waiting to make a huge raid on the beloved HQ. Biggs was panicking and he issued immediate and hasty orders as they prepare for a big raid.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>SOLDIER! This is Biggs, founder of SOLDIER, wants your full cooperation on the matter. Jeffrey's forces have invaded our HQ. I am ordering additional operatives to defend the entrance. This is an order, not a request! Move out!</i>" Biggs commanded as he feels pressure within the HQ. <br />
					"<i>Omega Team, defend the balcony. Beta Team, help in charging the hallway for the attackers.</i>" Serez commanding the teams. <br />
					"<i>But we don't have our leaders anymore.</i>" An operative sadly said. <br />
					"<i>Your original leaders may have been dead but the order stands. Defend those areas. Zeta Team will try to help in keeping the outside safe. We will use the secondary exit to go outside and prevent further attacks to pass through.</i>" Serez said as they prepare to defend their HQ. <br />
					"<i>Alright...</i>" An operative hesitantly replied.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					The 2 teams then went on to defend while Zeta Team charges outside. It didn't take long for the monsters to invade the HQ. Siege weapons bombed the HQ while infantry gets in. Zeta Team alerted HQ of their presence and issued an immediate backup. As their backup arrived, Zeta Team silently retreated and let the backups fend off the attackers. They eventually died. Monsters kept on pouncing at them, tearing them all apart. Bioterrorists poison them, suffocating them entirely. The HQ is now engulfed in green smoke. Omega Team, covering the balcony, had to stand their ground. Monsters appeared out of nowhere, archers giving ranged support by firing their rain of arrows at the HQ. This led to an immediate defeat of the Omega Team and they were wiped out easily.</p>
				<p id="content">
					Beta Team awaits the monsters in the hallway. With the balcony occupied, the more experienced team took more caution for their arrival. Bioterrorists charged through the doors and the monsters used the ventilation system as entry. They rushed in and fought for their survival. Indeed, they seemed no match as well. Nicole fired at the beam supports to halt the advance of the other monsters. They were surrounded by all corners, nowhere to go. Nicole fought for her survival, her forces are starting to be reduced second by second. A huge scratch nearly took her out for good but a last-minute sacrifice from her comrade cost his life and saved hers. Still, battle continues. When she realizes that her numbers are not enough to kill the remaining monsters on the hallway, she called for a retreat.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Beta Team! Retreat now! The monsters are too much to handle. We can't take them all! Retreat by the second exit.</i>" Nicole issuing a retreat. <br />
					"<i>Roger that, ma'am!</i>" Beta Team affirms.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					With the Omega Team wiped out, they slowly retreated as her remaining forces fought them off. Battered, they managed to make it to the exit. Nicole immediately shut the gates to prevent them from chasing them. The HQ is now in flames.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Phew! We could have killed the rest if Zeta Team was in there.</i>" An operative said as Beta Team made it out alive. <br />
					"<i>What happened to Zeta Team? They were supposed to help us!</i>" Nicole asking the question while she is exhausted. <br />
					"<i>I don't know, ma'am. If they were helping us, then there wouldn't be so many monsters that have invaded the hallways.</i>" An operative replying in exhaustion too. <br />
					"<i>The monsters came in the balcony. Omega Team was lost as they weren't able to defend them.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
					"<i>There's another way they came in. It's surprising that the ones in the balcony are weaker compared to the bigger ones. The bigger ones came in through the front entrance. We got jumped from every corner. Omega Team was lost as well.</i>" An operative said pointing to the destroyed entrance. <br />
					"<i>If the bigger ones went up to the hallway and came from the entrance, then the entrance was completely left with a few patrols. Zeta Team had a lot of patrols, how come they would send only a few? It's weird.</i>" Nicole asking in a much higher tone. <br />
					"<i>Zeta Team requested for some backup but those backups were the on-training operatives. There's no way they could fend off the monsters out there with little experience!</i>" An operative replied. <br />
					"<i>Then Zeta Team left them fending the forces alone. They betrayed too. How about Biggs?</i>" Nicole furiously making the remark. <br />
					"<i>Biggs was nowhere to be found. After issuing those orders, he left abruptly. I can't believe that Zeta Team would leave us.</i>" An operative said. <br />
					"<i>Wait... If Zeta Team left us, then they're after Raz! Serez holds a grudge on Raz and framing him for the destruction of Ilang village. They must be stopped!</i>" Nicole thinking of the plan. <br />
					"<i>But we don't know where they went, ma'am. We can't follow them anymore! We need to get out safely. Jeffrey's forces could be here in any moment. They're searching for us now.</i>" An operative suggesting they escape already. <br />
					"<i>I won't rest until we rescue Raz from the clutches of Biggs and Serez.</i>" Nicole replied as they prepare to leave.

				<p id="content">
					The SOLDIER HQ begins to crumble. A terrible shaking shook the building. Far away, Jeffrey glares at Nicole unwarily. They left immediately without a slight hesitation.</p>
