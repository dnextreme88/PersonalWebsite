			<h2>Chapter 11: Price Of Freedom</h2>
				<p id="content">
					It's finally morning. Sadly, they couldn't greet the sun a gleeful smile for they are enclosed in a steel chamber with barely an air to pass through. They woke up and their back hurts. Their mats are too hard to sleep on. Most of them just didn't sleep while others who were tired had to rest after a hard mission. Eventually, a bioterrorist guard in steel-plated armor approaches them. As he carries his greenish crowbar, he carefully stares at each SOLDIER members with some suspicious motives.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Pfft. SOLDIER members. Disgraceful.</i>" The huge guard said in a robotic manner. <br />
					"<i>What? What did you just say, big guy?</i>" Nicole responded angrily. <br />
					"<i>Disgraceful. All of you are such a waste! You deserve to die!</i>" The huge guard angrily said as he stares at each of the operatives. <br />
					"<i>We will die in honor. But then, you cannot destroy our group.</i>" Nicole replied. <br />
					"<i>Say all you want, woman. We await orders as you won't see the glistening sun from the outside! You will die and won't live to see another day! Hahaha!</i>" The huge guard hysterically laughing. <br />
					"<i>How will we get out of here?</i>" Nicole turned her attention to Raz. <br />
					"<i>There must be a way. We can't be stuck here waiting to be killed. That's like a prey waiting for the predator.</i>" Raz responded. <br />
					"<i>So how?</i>" Nicole asked.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz took a moment to think for a while. The guard went a little farther. Then he came up with an idea.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Ah! I got an idea! You should distract the guard as we attempt to grab the crowbar he holds.</i>" Raz having a plan. <br />
					"<i>What will I do?</i>" Nicole asked. <br />
					"<i>Try seducing that guard. He'll probably stick his eyes in you for a moment. Then let him come in. We will play dead, as if we went back to sleep and once he enters the cell, we will pounce on him like a cat.</i>" Raz said as he pointed at the guard's crowbar. <br />
					"<i>They don't like a human. They're possessed.</i>" Nicole responded with hesitation. <br />
					"<i>They are. Bioterrorists are human clones so they are human in nature but they have been risen to fight against the real humans. They still have the emotions that we have.</i>" Raz defending his statement. <br />
					"<i>Ok, ok. I'll do that.</i>" Nicole said as she called the guard.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Nicole lured the guard and she did her thing. She did all sorts of seductions she could think of. This lured the guard to come near the cell and stare at her while other members sneaked carefully and snatched the crowbar in a matter of seconds.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>We got the crowbar! I bet this can let us out?</i>" Raz happily expressed their success though the guard immediately got out. <br />
					"<i>Sure, you got me though you won't leave here alive.</i>" The huge guard remarked and fled their cell. He sounded the alarm to send the forces in alert.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					They used the crowbar to break the bars and get out. It took awhile before they made a big hole and got out successfully. The alarm sounded and the bioterrorists were alerted from their posts. The first wave of monsters and bioterrorists rushed in. They got surrounded. They all try to kill each of them, avoiding the poisonous attacks as necessary. Quite easy. The second wave came in, this time with ranged support firing poisonous bolts. Nicole ordered some of her men to focus on the archers as they focus on the melee.</p>
				<p id="content">
					Raz worked alone, destroying monster after monster. It didn't take long for him to be noticed by Nicole and she helped him deal with the monsters. Monsters come in while they are reduced in numbers. It lead to the point where they have vanquished every foe.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Phew! A hard fought battle once again.</i>" Nicole exclaimed as she wiped her sweat. <br />
					"<i>Well, at least that's the last of them. Don't think we'd face another wave.</i>" Raz hesitantly responded. <br />
					"<i>Yeah. The facility is just crawling with nasties.</i>" Nicole replied while looking at the corpses of foes she slain.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					From the balcony, more bioterrorists appeared. This time, there were no monsters to back them up. It seems that this is the last wave. Raz was far away as Nicole and her remaining forces held their ground and fend them off. From afar, Raz was somewhat hesitant, still couldn't get over the honor that has snatched his own self while he looks to Nicole and her men. Raz has to make a decision.</p>
