			<h2>Chapter 10: Close To You</h2>
				<p id="content">
					While in a circular chamber with some of Nicole's members sharing a cell with them, Raz gets to know Nicole a little more.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>So Nicole. How long have you been staying with SOLDIER?</i>" Raz asked when he noticed Nicole lonely. <br />
					"<i>I've only been here for a month. I was relegated to fighting private and smaller missions before I got promoted to the main roster. My first assignment was to defend Karuhat against those monsters. Sadly, we failed. Now, we are scared to report back to Biggs about it.</i>" Nicole responded as she turns to face Raz. <br />
					"<i>I see. Have you ever faced them before?</i>" Raz asked as he stares at Nicole. <br />
					"<i>Yes, however they are not as fierce and big as the ones we faced at Karuhat village. Monsters I faced on smaller missions weren't really that tough. This one was challenging. How about you, Raz?</i>" Nicole said as he stared back at Raz. <br />
					"<i>Yes. That hooded guy is behind all this. Mutations on Karuhat were strange. At first, we didn't realize we would not only face monsters but humans equipped with poison items. They are called bioterrorists. Spreading plague over the place and infecting other people.</i>" Raz explained. <br />
					"<i>That's so strange. It's like facing and killing our own men then? How long have you been fighting?</i>" Nicole asked. <br />
					"<i>I've been with SOLDIER for around 3 months. Right now, I'm not even sure myself where I stand. It's like I fight for the good and end up nothing.</i>" Raz responded while he looks at his badge. <br />
					"<i>Don't worry. What's important is in your heart. You don't follow something if you wouldn't like its outcome, do you? At first, I didn't even want to join here. Fighting isn't my thing however I realized that I must fight to defend myself and stand up for my own. I decided to follow that and took some training to get me acquainted in the fields of war. That hardwork and perseverance really paid off. Now, I'm here in SOLDIER. From smaller and private missions, I get more challenging missions such as this one. Challenge is part of life. If you have never been challenged, then your effort isn't worth it. That's just me.</i>" Nicole said in a serious tone while staring at Raz as well. <br />
					"<i>Very inspiring. So you're saying you shouldn't be scared with Biggs then?</i>" Raz asked as he starts to laugh. <br />
					"<i>Haha! It was just my first mission. Of course, I would be scared. But soon, I'll be used to this.</i>" Nicole laughed as well. <br />
					"<i>How has SOLDIER molded you? I'm curious. I just need to find myself.</i>" Raz asking another question. <br />
					"<i>SOLDIER helped me become more independent. It's all about skills. If they see you as a skilled individual, they would get you. If you're someone like me who voluntarily joined, they'll see some of your skills through trainings. It also helped me to be strong and fight for what's right.</i>" Nicole responded as she stood up and clinched her fists. <br />
					"<i>Nifty. I have seen the death of a friend in my hands, witnessed betrayals, killed injustices. I am lonely yet I couldn't find something in me.</i>" Raz exclaimed as he looks back at his badge. <br />
					"<i>What is that?</i>" Nicole turned back and asked. <br />
					"<i>Honor. How can I protect my honor? I am at a lost.</i>" Raz responded. <br />
					"<i>For me, honor can be quite a burden at times.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
					"<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>" Raz hesitantly asked probably not paying attention. <br />
					"<i>Haha! No story is worth hearing.</i>" Nicole responded with laughter.

					Nicole and Raz giggled with joy. They got closer to each other. Raz secretly stares at Nicole's green eyes as they giggled back and forth. It was beautiful. Indeed, it's tantalizing like a gemstone, that of jade. He couldn't resist staring at her. Eventually, they're quite sleepy and went to rest as the night fades.</p>
