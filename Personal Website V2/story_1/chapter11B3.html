				<p id="content">
					Raz and Nicole made it back to HQ in one piece though injured. Biggs already sensed that Drix didn't come with them and knew that he died fighting. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>I see that Drix isn't with you, Raz and Nicole. It's unfortunate.</i>" Biggs noticed that Drix died. <br />
					"<i>Yeah. He died fighting. Nicole was next and I luckily saved her or she'll be gone too.</i>" An injured Raz confirms his suspicions. <br />
					"<i>SOLDIER is slowly losing war after war. Cities have to be constantly defended. They just keep on coming.</i>" Biggs looking around as he becomes worried of the situation. <br />
					"<i>How's Zeta Team doing in Ilang village?</i>" An injured Nicole asked out of the blue. <br />
					"<i>No reports yet. I hope they aren't gone too.</i>" Biggs said still worried and starts to walk around. <br />
					"<i>So what's my next mission?</i>" Raz asked. <br />
					"<i>None for now. Just stay low. You need rest.</i>" Biggs replied as he over thinks of the situation. <br />
					"<i>I couldn't seem to rest. I'm still itching for a fight.</i>" Raz said in a somewhat displeasing manner. He clinches his fists hardly. <br />
					"<i>Don't worry, Raz. Your wounds need to be tended before you can engage in battle again.</i>" Nicole encouraging Raz to be treated first. <br />
					"<i>Take the advice. It's for your safety.</i>" Biggs affirmed. He pats him on the back. <br />
					"<i>We're slowly losing men, Biggs! I lost my elites in that war! Jeffrey has had enough playing games with me. He must be stopped!</i>" Raz shouted out of nowhere. He was furious on the lost of his team. <br />
					"<i>Chill, Raz. We will eventually get there and -</i>" Biggs said in mid-sentence. <br />
					"<i>And kill more of his men!? We barely get close to destroying his most elite forces. That Almon killed all my elite. We haven't even got a hand on Jeffrey at all! I'll go and head to Ilang village alone. If Jeffrey is there, I'll make sure I get close to him and pay for his actions! I'll kill him myself!</i>" Raz interrupted and continues his rage. <br />
					"<i>But, Raz...</i>" Nicole said in a soft voice as she sees Raz exiting the office furiously. Biggs and Nicole began to worry about Raz, as if they're guilty.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz furiously left. His wounds wasn't tended anymore and didn't bother getting medicated. When he exited the HQ, Nicole and Biggs continue the conversation. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>What happened to Raz?</i>" Nicole asked Biggs. <br />
					"<i>I don't know. He's after vengeance. He can't go and kill Jeffrey himself.</i>" Biggs replied as he looks down on himself. <br />
					"<i>We should help him, Biggs.</i>" Nicole puts Biggs' chin up and looks at him. <br />
					"<i>Good idea. I want you to follow him on his destination tomorrow. See whatever he is planning and report it to me.</i>" Biggs commanding Nicole. <br />
					"<i>Will do, master.</i>" Nicole followed his orders. <br />
					"<i>Be careful out there.</i>" Biggs said as Nicole turns around. She then exits the office and headed to the medics.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Nicole got her wounds tended. She was adviced to take some rest until the night off. Although she's feeling fine now, she is worried of the current situation SOLDIER is having lately. She, too overthinks about it and couldn't sleep. She looks by the ceiling, wondering what to do next. The next day, she got up from bed, took a bath and dressed up. She had her meal and finally she sets up to follow Raz on his destination along with his Beta Team members. </p>
