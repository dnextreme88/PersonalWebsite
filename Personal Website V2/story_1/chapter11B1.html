				<p><i>You picked Hero Line. Your decision will affect how the characters will act towards you.</i></p>
				<p id="content">
					Raz decided to help Nicole's forces. He immediately went back and protected the secret agent from the attackers. Eventually, they destroyed the last wave and got out of the facility intact. SOLDIER members was full of joy for successfully getting out and vanquishing the renegades. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Thank you Raz for helping us.</i>" Nicole expressed her gratitude after they made it out. They were so exhausted. <br />
					"<i>Don't mention it. My honor must stand.</i>" Raz replied with his determination intact. <br />
					"<i>You still think about that honor, huh? We appreciate you helping us on this endeavor despite our failure at Karuhat village. I hope we get back to HQ in one piece.</i>" Nicole said. She tingles as she's scared to show up in HQ. <br />
					"<i>Think positive. We will get there. Don't think about the failure, we were outnumbered. SOLDIER should have sent more forces to defend the area. That way, we can tilt the scales to our favor rather than getting captured.</i>" Raz giving a motivation. <br />
					"<i>Yeah thanks for the heads-up. Let's get back to HQ immediately.</i>" Nicole ended as they start to leave.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					They were helped out by SOLDIER and got in the van as they leave the facility. Raz looks back at the facility and thinks deeply once again. Nicole patted him on the shoulders and said he shouldn't worry about the facility anymore for it is done. Then they headed back to HQ quickly. At the HQ, Biggs was surprised to see them. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Nicole! Raz! It's good to see you both!</i>" Biggs surprised of their arrival. He hasn't seen both leaders for some time. <br />
					"<i>Hey, Biggs. It was hell out there but luckily we got out alive though we lost some men. Good thing, we weren't turned into clones or we could be gone.</i>" Raz funnily joking around. <br />
					"<i>Yeah. I really want to thank Raz for the big help! It means a lot!</i>" Nicole expressing her gratitude again. She felt more confident to face Biggs. <br />
					"<i>Don't mind it. I just wanna save you, Nicole.</i>" Raz replied back. <br />
					"<i>Oh, that's sweet.</i>" Nicole responded as she blushed. <br />
					"<i>Haha! Enough with the compliments. Let's get back to business.</i>" Biggs laughed hysterically. <br />
					"<i>Right!</i>" Raz and Nicole quickly said. Biggs made the gesture to go to the office.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Biggs then went to the office and the two followed. He gave them a cup of coffee and some snacks. Raz and Nicole sat on the couch together while Biggs sat on his own chair and starts to discuss some plans. </p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Our scouts report that waves of bioterrorists have also attacked the city of Navang. Apparently, Omega Team headed by Drix defends the area but they are not enough to thwart the enemy forces back. You will both pair up and assist Omega Team in defending the area.</i>" Biggs commanded as he drinks his coffee. <br />
					"<i>But Navang is a heavily-guarded city. The walls are good enough to stand when they launch an attack in the city.</i>" Nicole explained. <br />
					"<i>Yes however it is a prized city that we must preserve. We shouldn't allow the enemy to touch our resources when they infiltrate the area.</i>" Biggs replied. <br />
					"<i>Ok, that's cool with me. You cool with that, Nicole?</i>" Raz affirms as she pats Nicole on the shoulders. <br />
					"<i>Yes. How about the forces in Karuhat village? There's no one to guard the area.</i>" Nicole replied and looked at Raz. <br />
					"<i>Don't worry about Karuhat village. I understand that you got captured by Jeffrey. I'll send a different group to guard that area. Gather your forces and head to the Navang plains by noon.</i>" Biggs ordered as he stood up and dismissed them. <br />
					"<i>Alright. Will do as requested.</i>" Raz said as he and Nicole both stood up too. <br />
					"<i>I'm counting on you.</i>" Biggs ended as the two exited his office.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Raz and Nicole were granted some hours of rest before departing. After that, they gathered and assembled their forces. Raz told Nicole that his group and her group will be merged into one, in which Nicole agreed. Nicole's forces were then merged with Raz's Beta Team. This will be the new Beta Team. Raz appointed Nicole as his second-hand enforcer. </p>
