			<h2>Chapter 9: The Dust That Remains</h2>
				<p id="content">
					Raz travels to Karuhat village. As Raz goes there, he saw another group of Jeffrey's forces advance through the ruined village. From an overseeing cliff, he sees a woman drenched in brown-clad shades and a long brown coat battling the monsters. Raz stretched his muscles and small black wings started to appear at his spines. He had no idea where it came from. He dropped down and confronted the woman. He unsheathes his sword and killed 2 monsters. Nicole turned back and was surprised that someone helped her.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Don't worry, woman. I come to help.</i>" Raz explained as Nicole turned around in shock. <br />
					"<i>Oh thank you! These monsters have attacked this village recently. I was tasked to defend this area.</i>" Nicole said happily as he looks and points at the corpses of the slain monsters. <br />
					"<i>I see. The village is all but ashes now, a shadow of its former glory. I'm Raz by the way.</i>" Raz introduced himself as he looks around their surroundings and shook Nicole's hands. <br />
					"<i>I'm Nicole, secret operative and leads this SOLDIER group tasked at Karuhat village.</i>" Nicole introducing herself as well as she shook Raz's hands in return. <br />
					"<i>A pleasure to meet you, Nicole.</i>" Raz greeting her back. <br />
					"<i>This village was reported as the first site for the mutation to happen. Your group seems to be in-charge of this. I hope you do well.</i>" Raz giving an encouragement. Nicole puts up her submachine gun and prepares. <br />
					"<i>We will do that. We shall get rid of these monsters once and for all!</i>" Nicole ended with determination in mind.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					More monsters started jumping at them as they battle side-to-side. They just keep on coming from the roofs, the balcony, the doors and every other areas they are surrounded with. Raz slashed every monster as Nicole fires away. Nicole calls for backup but no one responds. Eventually, they got surrounded. Jeffrey appears from a cliff along with Almon, one of his henchmen. He used a flashlight and pointed it to them. SOLDIER operatives were also captured as well.</p>
				<div id="dialogues">
					"<i>Well, well. Look at what we have here. Raz and his secretary. I care to digress. You never changed, Raz. I can't believe we would meet again at the same area where it all started.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed as he gets up on his pedestal. <br />
					"<i>It's more of a secretary. I realized she leads the group here. We can sort this out if we stop this.</i>" Raz trying to calm things down. <br />
					"<i>For what? As I told you before, evil is around you. There's nothing you can do to stop that.</i>" Jeffrey responded angrily as his monsters looked heavily on the two operatives. <br />
					"<i>Wait, you have met before? What a coincidence!</i>" Nicole responded surprisingly. <br />
					"<i>Indeed. Raz is too stubborn for it.</i>" Jeffrey said as he points at Raz. <br />
					"<i>You're the monster! Evil runs through you.</i>" Raz shouted loudly. <br />
					"<i>And so let it be. For your treacherous crimes, I will make sure you regret landing on me again.</i>" Jeffrey said as he stood up from his pedestal. <br />
					"<i>Now, Almon. Take these hostiles and make them test samples on our lab.</i>" Jeffrey added. <br />
					"<i>Roger sir.</i>" Almon following his commands.
				</div>
				<p id="content">
					Jeffrey ordered Almon to capture them. Their bodyguards stood firm as Almon gets down from the cliff. Raz and Nicole tried to resist but the bodyguards beat them up, tied them and was carried like backpacks as they exit Karuhat village. They were captured along with the rest of the group as the sun starts to set.</p>
