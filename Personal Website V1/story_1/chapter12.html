<h2>Chapter 12: Three-Way Dance</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Raz was battered after a gruesome fight with Jeffrey's forces a while back. Almon, one of Jeffrey's leaders died as well as SOLDIER's Omega Team leader, Drix. Furious for the betrayals, Raz sets off alone and Jeffrey has some questions to answer. While travelling, he encountered Jeffrey's forces and himself. A seemingly sly smile was painted on Jeffrey's face.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Raz! You foolish boy! You have slain one of my commanders. We just went to Navang and saw the ashes that you left. One of your commanders died too! So tragic.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed as he gets off his pedestal and took of his hood. <br />
	"<i>Jeffrey, enough of this! Let's get this over with! You had enough killing us.</i>" Raz angrily replied as he crosses his arms and sweeps. <br />
	"<i>Oh yeah? Not now.</i>" Jeffrey boldly stated. He paused for a moment then said. <br />
	"<i>My men and I are going to Ilang once again to reclaim what was once ours. My commander, Almon failed to retrieve it for us. I shall retrieve it with my own forces.</i>" Jeffrey said as he shoved his palm to Raz. <br />
	"<i>What do you think will you reclaim on that area? You won't go there easily!</i>" Raz still angrily replied. <br />
	"<i>Our cloning pods. We will multiply, while SOLDIER continues to divide. SOLDIER reclaimed that, now we are taking it back. I appreciate them keeping it for us but the time has come to retrieve it. If you want to join our endeavor, you are willing to do so... death awaits you.</i>" Jeffrey challenged Raz. <br />
	"<i>I'm willing to die for my honor, that's for sure! I'll make sure you won't grab your pods.</i>" Raz exclaimed. <br />
	"<i>We'll see for that. You and SOLDIER won't even stand a chance against my men!</i>" Jeffrey said as he shows off his forces.

		The sound of operatives marching through the sandy road was heard not far from where Raz and Jeffrey is. It was Raz's Beta Team, with their new leader, Nicole. They finally found Raz and Jeffrey making arguments at each other. Both men were surprised by their sudden interference. Nicole shouted from the distance.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Raz! We knew we'd follow you here! You need to rest. You're too battered!</i>" Nicole worries too much for Raz that she followed him to this area. <br />
	"<i>Ahh, look at what we have here! You're that woman we caught at Karuhat a few days ago. I can't believe both of you escaped us that easily!</i>" Jeffrey remarked and immediately glances at Nicole. Nicole looked back angrily. <br />
	"<i>What's the problem with that? SOLDIER wants your forces to be eliminated and so do you.</i>" Nicole angrily replied. She drew her submachine gun. <br />
	"<i>Nicole, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to rest as well? You don't have to worry about me.</i>" Raz said as Nicole and Jeffrey looks at him. <br />
	"<i>I had my rest but I was tasked by Biggs to go follow you. You need to go back to HQ.</i>" Nicole said as she was commanded by Biggs to follow him. <br />
	"<i>I can't right now. I will stop Jeffrey's forces myself if I have to!</i>" Raz responded. Jeffrey looked at Raz with such disguise in his face. <br />
	"<i>You can't do that you're just going -</i>" Nicole in mid-sentence. <br />
	"<i>Let's stop this drama! I'll be waiting for SOLDIER at Ilang village. Death awaits your men, Raz.</i>" Jeffrey interrupts as he implies strongly on Raz's arrival there. He's quite irritated. <br />
	"<i>It won't happen until I kill you first!</i>" Raz ended as he shouts at Jeffrey.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Jeffrey and his forces left with a sly smile. Once they left, Raz and Nicole came into a conversation. Beta Team stands by on-guard.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>So, Raz. What else did he told you?</i>" Nicole asks as she wants some answers. <br />
	"<i>They're heading to Ilang village. We can't allow that to happen!</i>" Raz feeling pressure and still mad. <br />
	"<i>It can't be. Zeta Team is defending that area. We must tell HQ about this.</i>" Nicole said as she looks on the other direction. <br />
	"<i>You should go and tell Biggs about it. We can't lose another city under their control.</i>" Raz exclaimed as he pats her on the shoulder. <br />
	"<i>Raz, you should come.</i>" Nicole urges Raz. <br />
	"<i>Nah I can't. You should hurry up. I'll go to Ilang village myself. Take care.</i>" Raz denies. <br />
	"<i>Be careful. You may never know what lies ahead.</i>" Nicole bids farewell. Raz carried his sword once again. <br />
	"<i>I will. Thank you.</i>" Raz ended as he prepares alone again.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Beta Team then left. Nicole was worried about the safety of Raz but he just dismissed it with a soft smile. After they left, Raz went ahead as well. He has to tackle a journey up ahead.</p>
