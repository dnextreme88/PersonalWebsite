<h2>Chapter 18: End Of The Line</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Raz escapes hurriedly away from the pursuing Alpha Team. They eventually ended up at Route 409. Raz never realized that Alpha Team cornered him, as they were immediately on their posts just waiting for his arrival. His movement was predicted. The operatives were at corners, rocks, an atrium and even sent a helicopter. They were positioned early and were lined up like dominoes. Those in the atrium lined up like piles of ants, horizontally stacked together with enough space to draw their guns. Those who were near the rocks drew their batons instead. Raz is in for the fight of his life, as he faces his former colleagues alone without any help.</p>
		<p id="content">
		Raz slowly walks enemy territory. SOLDIER carefully looks at him while guns were drawn and were aimed at him. As he is on mid distance with them, Raz puts his arms on his hips and looks at them back.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Boy oh boy. The price of freedom is steep.</i>" Raz said as he nods his head side-to-side and blinks his eye. He then unsheathes his sword from his back and pull it near him and said. <br />
	"<i>Embrace your dreams. And, whatever happens. Protect your honor... as SOLDIER! Come and get it!</i>" Raz said as he slowly bring his sword down and wielded it like a hero, ran forward and did a sword sweep.

		<p id="content">
		He was on his own. His mind is filled up with justice and revenge. All he cared was fighting for what's right and make them realize that he never intended to destroy Ilang but he was after Jeffrey, for he had caused all this chaos within their land. While he battles Alpha Team, he used his wings to fly and dodge bullets. He thinks of Nicole occasionally, telling himself that he has a crush on her but could never say it because SOLDIER limits the relationships to work-related stuffs and it just ends up to that point only. Whereas Nicole showed her concern for Raz by informing him of Biggs' plans on him. It greatly helped Raz, though it was a small effort, it meant a huge help to him.</p>
		<p id="content">
		At the height of battle, Zeta Team arrived. Without hesitation, Serez commanded his team to take him out. Raz knew it was Serez who blamed him and the one that caused SOLDIER to turn on him. He is going to pay dearly for his actions. Raz periodically receives gunshots but due to SOLDIER blood, he doesn't die easily and it only injures him. He utilized his wings again to give aerial support and attack SOLDIER operatives. It was shortlived, as his wings was damaged by the helicopter causing it to shrink and rendering it unusable.</p>
		<p id="content">
		After such awhile, he had a lot of bloodstains on his clothes. He was battered and exhausted. SOLDIER is too much to handle for one man to eliminate. He had been drastically slow. Then it came to the point where he thought he eliminated them all but he was wrong. Reinforcements came in along with another helicopter to add insult to injury. There just seems to be no end to it. Once again, he held his ground as they slowly approach him. With such exhaustion, he could no longer kill them and he fell immediately after numerous bullets fired at him. He was still slowly opening his eyes then he heard Serez's voice out of nowhere.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Serez, we seem to have slain Raz!</i>" An operative said as Serez slowly approaches Raz. Serez follows on. <br />
	"<i>This is good. Biggs will be happy to know we have slain the betrayer!</i>" A joyful Serez exclaimed as he slowly approaches the downed Raz. <br />
	"<i>I don't think he is dead yet. Shoot him straight in the face.</i>" Serez commanded the operative as he ended his statement. <br />
	"<i>Will be done.</i>" An operative said happily following his orders. <br />
	"<i>Nicole...</i>" Raz in his dying breath.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Raz was then shot point blank. He tilts his head and closed his eyes as his vision starts to fade in darkness. Serez and his men left after the battle. It was over.</p>
