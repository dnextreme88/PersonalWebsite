<h2>Chapter 3: In The HQ</h2>
		<p id="content">
		A victorious Beta Team reported back to HQ with smiles on their faces. They successfully prevented the terrorists' attempt to pillage the village. The rescued hostages were then tended for medical care. Some suffered grievous wounds, some minor and some on the verge of death. Beta Team reported back not long after the Alpha Team made it back too. There, Raz and Aaron headed out to Zey's office to give a report to the mission's progress.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Hey there, Zey. We successfully thwarted the advance of the terrorists at Route 331. I bet that's another plus to you, huh?</i>" Aaron exclaimed as he looks at Zey. <br />
	"<i>Umm no? That was an easy mission!</i>" Zey laughed. <br />
	"<i>Okay enough with the handsome moves, Aaron. Zey wants a serious thing.</i>" Raz responded out of nowhere. Zey laughed silently this time. <br />
	"<i>Haha. I'm a serious guy. Am I not fit?</i>" Aaron replied to Raz's statement. <br />
	"<i>Don't worry, Aaron. You'll soon get what you need.</i>" Zey exclaimed. She then directed them to Biggs. <br />
	"<i>Sir, we were able to neutralize all terrorists in the said village as well as rescue hostages stucked in the midst of war.</i>" Raz reported. Biggs turned his chair around to see Aaron and Raz. <br />
	"<i>Good job, Alpha Team and Beta Team. You did a good job out. I knew I could count on you.</i>" Biggs congratulating both teams. He let them both sit down. <br />
	"<i>We're glad to help, sir.</i>" Aaron said. <br />
	"<i>Indeed. That's the spirit of SOLDIER!</i>" Biggs exclaimed with intense vigor.

		Biggs then stood up and were searching for some files laid on his desk. He had a lot of files that's scattered around. Aaron and Raz just fervently looked at him patiently as he looks for those files. Then he procrastinated and will just find these files later. He then issued another mission for Alpha Team and Beta Team to undertake.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Now just awhile back, we received another call requiring our services. It came from an unknown number. I'd like your teams to do another mission again. You'll be heading to Karuhat village to investigate the area of another possible terrorist attack.</i>" Biggs said. <br />
	"<i>Okay, sir. We'll do our best.</i>" Raz exclaimed as he and Aaron starts to stand up. <br />
	"<i>I know you both will. I'm counting on you, Raz and Aaron.</i>" Biggs wishing good luck on their next mission. As Raz and Aaron were about to exit the office, Biggs told them one last thing. <br />
	"<i>Oh and before you both leave, go to the pod rooms and change those armors with new ones. You'll need to be prepared. You'll be going once all your men are done donning their new armors as well. Goodluck, Alpha and Beta Teams.</i>" Biggs happily ended. <br />
	"<i>Yes, sir. Thank you.</i>" Aaron thanking Biggs as he and Raz exits the office.

		Raz and Aaron then informed their groups of the new task. Then they headed to the pod rooms to replace their worn armor with new ones. Once they're settled, they left the HQ to carry out the new task.</p>
