<h2>Chapter 16: Where It All Began</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Raz goes to Karuhat village after a conversation with Nicole. He descends down as he looks upon the abandoned village. It is a shadow of its former glory. Soon, he saw Jeffrey's forces coming into a distant area. He immediately hid in a bush as he waits for their arrival. They carry with them captured SOLDIER operatives and brought with them the cloning pod they reclaimed in Ilang. Looks like they'll establish Karuhat as their base.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
		They carried the operatives like dolls. They were battered and beaten up badly. Raz looks on with anguish. The bioterrorists slew them one by one and before the last one was executed, Raz immediately got out from his bush and appeared to his enemies.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>So here you are again, Raz. Here at the place where it all began. Karuhat. You missed this place?</i>" Jeffrey having the evil smile while mocking Raz. <br />
	"<i>I would say I did. I knew I would find you here, Jeffrey.</i>" Raz said as he bows his head down. <br />
	"<i>What other reason could there be if I weren't here? Karuhat has a lot of history in us. You know it, Raz.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed. <br />
	"<i>Yes. This is where Alpha Team got squashed. I remember it all when I was still in SOLDIER. Now they are hunting me down.</i>" Raz said while his head is still down. <br />
	"<i>You are being hunted down!? I told you before, SOLDIER is the one creating all this evil! Now I made you believe in that. I'm a success. Let me be the one to say that you are all alone now. No one to help you, but yourself. Trapped and freezing at this forgotten city. You're near to extinction.</i>" Jeffrey urging Raz to turn back. He gave him advices. <br />
	"<i>SOLDIER is not an evil organization. Whatever happens, I'm still living up to my honor. No one can steal it away.</i>" Raz still being firm in his honor. <br />
	"<i>You believe in that motto. Sure, you won't believe me that Biggs would soon turn down SOLDIER. It's just a matter of time.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed as he looks back. <br />
	"<i>I don't care anymore. He commands SOLDIER to kill me. Before I could escape, I should finish my final duties and that is to kill you first.</i>" Raz angrily exclaimed as he clinched his fists alternately. <br />
	"<i>Never.</i>" Jeffrey remarkably said.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		The monsters started to pounce on him. Raz had to deal with the small but numerous hordes of monsters. He kicked the monsters as they come, slash them in halves, lunged them forward. He had to use all his might. Vengeance was all at his mind right now. Nothing could stop him from getting it. Eventually, SOLDIER came into the fray. The newly-reformed Alpha Team headed by Darl rushed in.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Here comes company!</i>" A bioterrorist said as he notices a horde of soldiers rushing through the gates. <br />
	"<i>Ah. SOLDIER again coming to save the world. You never stop hunting us down. What will make you stop?</i>" Jeffrey said. SOLDIER then came in to introduce themselves. <br />
	"<i>No need for concern, conceited evil. We eliminate all traces of your kin. That's our job.</i>" Darl said while Raz silently looked on as they converse. <br />
	"<i>You, Raz. Betrayer of SOLDIER. We are tasked to eliminate you by all means necessary. You shouldn't have been with us in the first place. Your betrayal is foul.</i>" Darl said. <br />
	"<i>I have never betrayed my work. A miscommunication by one of your leaders, Serez, made it all come into this. He blamed me for the destruction of Ilang. That's foul play while he sits there doing nothing. That ain't SOLDIER. I may not be in SOLDIER anymore, but I carry the SOLDIER mentality that my honor will always be valuable. I may be a fugitive, hunted down yet no amount of swords can take away my honor. I shall live with it and protect it always!</i>" Raz said as he explains his side. <br />
	"<i>There's no more honor in you, Raz! You shall die for your betrayal. You are not accepted.</i>" Darl angrily said as he shouts at Raz. <br />
	"<i>Hold up, SOLDIER!</i>" Jeffrey interrupted. <br />
	"<i>You're all betrayers. We are the heroes of this land. You're all copies. We eliminate the bad stench that plagues this land. Raz, you're no exception. SOLDIER will never live up to its glory to save their lands from the dark. Chaos will ruin everything you ever loved. Nothing shall be left alive.</i>" Jeffrey continued. <br />
	"<i>If that's the case, then we're ready to fight!</i>" Darl said as he draws his weapon. <br />
	"<i>Come what may. I hold no alliance from SOLDIER. Come and beat me!</i>" Raz said.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		The 3 leaders fought each other off, thus making this a three-way battle. There is no alliance, they fight whoever they fight. It was an all-out war. Bloodsheds are anywhere. No mercy. Raz fought everything. It was so chaotic. This led to a point where Raz was thinking of escaping in the midst of battle. He went into a nearby building and eliminated the hostiles first who were trying to advance and not let him get away. So he did and he had room to escape the village through the forest. However, SOLDIER reinforcements were actually passing in that area and he was caught.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>SOLDIER operatives. I repeat, SOLDIER operatives. Raz is trying to escape Karuhat village. Do not lose him at all costs.</i>" Darl said as he issues rushed orders when he noticed Raz was escaping. <br />
	"<i>Roger that.</i>" Alpha Team affirms.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		He then went to the far exit as he is being chased down. Luckily, monsters pounced on the poor operatives that helped him escape. Bioterrorists spread some smoke and Raz used this to his advantage to clear out some of his pursuers. It was like Jeffrey is helping him get out but that's not really the case. Darl managed to get him and fired a bullet at him. Raz blocked it with his sword. Raz rushed and pierced an unwary Darl heavily, killing him easily. Then he got out as quickly as he can whilst the pursuit on him. Meanwhile, SOLDIER lost the war and Jeffrey escaped.</p>
