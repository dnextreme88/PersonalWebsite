<h2>Chapter 7A2: Reclaiming It Back</h2>
		<p id="content">
		It's morning already. The gladiators are still sleeping, humbly snoring as the ray of light from outside their village gleefully approaches them. They were awakened by the light. Soon, Raz got off his mat and started shaking off his clothes as he feels itchy. He is greeted by one of the mutated humans.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>You, you there! I don't see you anywhere.</i>" The bioterrorists pointing at Raz and seems suspicious of him. <br />
	"<i>Ye... yes. I lost my dignity and all that I ever loved. I am a different person now. No remorse, no mercy.</i>" Raz replied. <br />
	"<i>I see you as a promising kid. I'm Almon. I was tasked to spearhead our group as we launch an offensive to SOLDIER, the group you betrayed, so we can diminish them in numbers. We will eliminate their forces.</i>" Almon introducing himself to Raz. <br />
	"<i>It's Raz. Nice to meet you. So where will we go?</i>" Raz replied. <br />
	"<i>That isn't important. Just follow us.</i>" Almon said as he showed Raz his new equipment.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Soon, they departed and headed to a forest. They saw a village from a distance, as they hide from the shrubs. Preparing for a preemptive strike, a group plan was discussed.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>That place over there is the Ilang village. It's a tiny area guarded by those nasty SOLDIER members. They seem intent protecting these villages as it is well-guarded by the scouts.</i>" Almon overlooking at the village. <br />
	"<i>They protect the people. That's all there is to say.</i>" Raz said. <br />
	"<i>A pod exists in that area. SOLDIER recovered the pod after a recent battle with us. Jeffrey said we must recover it back and since now that you're with us, you'll help us do this.</i>" Almon depending on Raz. <br />
	"<i>Uhh... of course I will!</i>" Raz hesitantly said as he scratched his head. <br />
	"<i>That pod is placed somewhere on the far end of that area, stashed in one of the warehouses there. If we get there, we can recover it.</i>" Raz further added. <br />
	"<i>Then we must make a run for it. SOLDIER won't bring us down.</i>" Almon braving his words.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		They headed towards the village slowly. As they approach the village, they killed 2 guards roaming the area. From there, SOLDIER was alerted by their presence and soon a huge melee was ensued. Raz focused on the ranged attackers as his allies focused on the melee. It didn't take long for SOLDIER to have their reinforcements arrive. Raz and his group immediately retreated to the open area.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>We're outnumbered! Fall back!</i>" An allied bioterrorist exclaimed as he gets scared of the growing numbers of SOLDIER. <br />
	"<i>We can't take them. Reinforcements have arrived!</i>" Another bioterrorist said as he noticed that reinforcements came. <br />
	"<i>There's too many! We have no backup. We can't win here. Retreat to the open area now!</i>" Almon affirming their wishes and they retreated.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		As they retreat to the open battlefield, the war continues. Raz's group was holding out as they fend off the SOLDIER members advancing through them. There's just too many of them to handle. Raz suggested throwing a smoke grenade to distract the opponents as they flee from the war. They successfully fled, but the objective of reclaiming the pod failed.</p>
