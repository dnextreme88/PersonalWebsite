<h2>Chapter 14: The Master's Plan</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Meanwhile, Nicole arrived in HQ. They had some encounters with Jeffrey's forces that caused them to arrive late. She proceeds to the office.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Biggs, Zeta Team needs help on Ilang village. Jeffrey's forces are advancing through that area.</i>" Nicole said as she rushes to inform Biggs about it. <br />
	"<i>How about Raz? Any news?</i>" Biggs said showing some concern. <br />
	"<i>We saw Raz talking to him. He was really intent on vengeance, master. He was heading to Ilang village alone.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
	"<i>We'll get help. I want the newly-reformed Alpha Team to head to that area and help.</i>" Biggs said as he gives out an order.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		It didn't take long for Zeta Team to arrive in HQ as well. After a failed mission on Ilang once again, this time to the point of clearly erasing it, Zeta Team heads to HQ for their report.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Ah Zeta Team. How is the progress? I thought you'd need reinforcements.</i>" Biggs greeting them frankly. <br />
	"<i>Zeta Team!? You can't possibly mean to arrive immediately.</i>" Nicole said as she was surprised by their arrival. <br />
	"<i>Well, sir. Ilang has been destroyed. The village is all but ashes now.</i>" Serez said as he feels guilty. <br />
	"<i>What!? How could that happen? Did you managed to save the pod?</i>" Biggs angrily exclaimed. <br />
	"<i>No. Jeffrey got the pod. Raz was in pursuit of him but he too managed to betray SOLDIER. He destroyed Ilang village.</i>" Serez blames Raz. <br />
	"<i>Raz has grown long enough to have his vengeance on him. He should be stopped.</i>" Biggs agreeing as he looks on the window. <br />
	"<i>Raz said he told Nicole that she will tell you about our status out there but I never expected that she would arrive at the same time as us.</i>" Serez continuing to blame Raz while looking at Nicole. <br />
	"<i>We got attacked that's why we got late. I never knew that it was already too late.</i>" Nicole saying her side. <br />
	"<i>It was too late, Nicole! We lost the village and now they have that pod back in their possession! It gets worst by the day.</i>" Serez angrily expressing his frustrations. <br />
	"<i>How about Raz?</i>" Nicole said. <br />
	"<i>He is in pursuit of Jeffrey. He had that black wings at his back, something to do with mutation. He has betrayed SOLDIER.</i>" Serez framing Raz for his treachery. <br />
	"<i>No, Raz wouldn't do that! He would never do that!</i>" Nicole said in a high tone. <br />
	"<i>You weren't there to see Ilang village, Nicole. How can you possibly think that way? He even killed my men.</i>" Serez being mad at Nicole then. <br />
	"<i>He'll never betray SOLDIER. I know your men got mutated and he was forced to kill them or else you would have died there yourselves! He was saving your lives!</i>" Nicole said angrily. <br />
	"<i>I knew you would say the same. Whatever that is, he still killed my men!</i>" Serez having a heated argument with Nicole.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		While they had their arguments, Biggs sat down and looked on the window. He thought so deeply about the current situation and how the future of SOLDIER currently stands. Biggs have heard enough of the arguments and he immediately stood up and calmed down both SOLDIER leaders before it could get any worse.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Enough! This is no time to fight. Serez, I believe that was a mutation. You never experienced that before, for sure. It turns out Raz has mutated into an inhuman. He's a half-ghost yet he still have characteristics of a human.</i>" Biggs calmed both leaders. <br />
	"<i>I see. So what's the plan?</i>" Serez was calmed down and immediately asked about the plan. <br />
	"<i>Neutralize Raz for his betrayal.</i>" Biggs said as he paused. <br />
	"<i>What? You can't do that! He didn't do anything wrong!</i>" Nicole surprised by Biggs' reaction. <br />
	"<i>You can't make that reason if you weren't there, Nicole. By hook or by crook, SOLDIER will eliminate Raz for his betrayal.</i>" Biggs promptly said as he made his decision. <br />
	"<i>He will be neutralized as commanded.</i>" Serez slyly said while glancing at Nicole angrily and preparing to leave the office.

		<p id="content">
		Nicole was suddenly mad at Serez. She left the office first followed by Serez. Alone, she told herself that she needs to go inform Raz about their plans. Beta Team then set off to once again find Raz and tell him of the master's plan.</p>
