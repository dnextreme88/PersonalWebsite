<h2>Chapter 4: The Mutation</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Alpha Team and Beta Team were dispatched to Karuhat village as per orders from Biggs. As they arrive, they immediately took positions so they're prepared for another possible terrorist infiltration in the area. They hid behind a near building and discussed their plans.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Alpha Team and Beta Team, start taking up your positions within the village. They'll attack soon.</i>" Aaron issuing an order. <br />
	"<i>Roger that, sir.</i>" Alpha & Beta Teams affirm.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		While the teams were taking up positions, an operative wandered around and noticed a strange man in black garment with hoods intact by the village's fountain area. He seems to be up to something and looks mysterious. The operative approached this strange man however he was held back with extreme force. The operative then drew his gun and attempted to fire but the strange man dodged it. Alpha and Beta Teams were alarmed by the gunfire so they immediately rushed to where the gunfire came from. When they arrived, the operative died. Multiple gunshots were spotted in the body and also noticed the black garment on the floor. After a while, a scream was heard not far from where the teams are. It was from a woman's voice, screaming for help.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>You guys heard that? It was from a woman's voice! She needs help! Quick!</i>" A scared and worried Aaron exclaimed. <br />
	"<i>Aaron, you and Alpha Team should try to seek that out. Find out what's going on there.</i>" A confident Raz commanded as he looks on where the scream is coming from. <br />
	"<i>Okay, Raz. Alpha Team, let's head out!</i>" Aaron ordered as they carefully walk near the forested building.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Alpha Team was ordered to seek out the area where the scream came from. Raz then commanded his team to stay in the fountain area and wait for Alpha Team's report. After a while, Alpha Team came out of the shadows, battered and bloody. The villagers were mutated and the terrorists were disguised as villagers, ambushing Alpha Team from behind. The terrorists were not the ordinary terrorists they were fighting. They had green blood, mutated backs, and evil grins but were still carrying guns, where its bullets are poison-enhanced that when it gets contact to a human, mutates it into a monster.</p>
		<p id="content">
		Both teams held their ground. Alpha Team were able to find the strange man, wearing that same black garment that they saw but retreated and went back to the fountain area. They were subsequently reduced to half. Now, Alpha and Beta Teams had to fend off the large number of poisoned villagers who'll likely not let them leave Karuhat alive. It was a back-and-forth battle. They were subsequently losing operatives as they are poisoned, mutate or even die and are forced to fight them. Aaron was strucked with poison and eventually mutated into a monster. The battle momentarily stopped when the strange man appeared in the middle. Raz approached him afterwards.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Halt! Stop this now!</i>" The strange man said as he slowly descends from the sky. <br />
	"<i>So you were the one wearing that black garment we saw earlier. I couldn't agree more.</i>" Raz surprisingly stated. <br />
	"<i>You got keen eyes, SOLDIER operative. You're right. Why did you bother coming here?</i>" The strange man asked. <br />
	"<i>We were tasked to defend this village for a possible terrorist attack but we never realized we're facing monsters.</i>" A surprised Raz exclaimed as he bowed down. <br />
	"<i>What are these monsters? Who commands them?</i>" Raz put his head up and asked as he points at the corpses. He is wondering how they turned into such. <br />
	"<i>These are bio-terrorists. They are no ordinary monsters. These are specialized monsters that mutates from a human victim. Deadly, they're troublesome to ordinary people like you. Heck, troublesome for SOLDIER, if you could consider that.</i>" The strange man hastily answered.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		At this time, Raz starts to wonder how this strange man knew they were from SOLDIER. He seems suspicious of the man's intentions. The way he talked and expressed himself provoked the ire of Raz. Alpha and Beta Teams looked on.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>How'd you know were from SOLDIER? SOLDIER shall put an end to this monstrosity. We will exterminate these monsters by any means!</i>" Raz demanded angrily. <br />
	"<i>SOLDIER. Foolish operatives fighting for justice! Haha!</i>" The strange man laughed loudly. Then he changed moods and became more serious. <br />
	"<i>You think you could destroy us? Nah. I'll show you why you'll never leave here alive.</i>" The strange man then swung his black garment and immediately left. <br />
	"<i>Hey, wait! You can't go anywhere!</i>" Raz trying to stop him.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		The battle continued. Alpha Team were mutated. One of Raz's men said they need to retreat as they are outnumbered however Raz said to continue fighting. Aaron got up and focused on destroying Raz by spitting acid on him. He was able to dodge it and kill the monster. The growing number of zombies and monsters increased and Beta Team is reduced to half as well.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Beta Team! Beta Team! Retreat now. I repeat. Retreat now! We're outnumbered!</i>" Raz issuing a retreat as they try to escape from the clutches of the monsters.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Beta Team then retreats through the backyard of the village. Raz briefly looks back at Karuhat village. They lost Aaron and his Alpha Team. Witnessing something horrific, they were terrified to face those monsters again. It was unusual for them to face monsters so strange and strong. They lacked manpower to withstand a chance to fight against them. Saddened by the loss of Aaron and his Alpha Team, Beta Team headed back to HQ unhappy.</p>
