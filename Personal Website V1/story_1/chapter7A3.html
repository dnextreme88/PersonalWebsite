<h2>Chapter 7A3: Wrath Of The Betrayer</h2>
		<p id="content">
		While they lost the war, the bioterrorists retreated to the forests. A hasty plan was discussed. Then they went back to the field, knowing that reporting back to Jeffrey will punish them. Though hesitant at first, they all agreed.</p>
		<p id="content">
		A preemptive strike from the bioterrorists prompted SOLDIER to retaliate. A smoke grenade was thrown again to distract SOLDIER members as the bioterrorists move from the smoke. As the dust clears, they jumped at unsuspecting SOLDIER members and neutralized the first batch with ease. Reinforcements arrived soon. Armed with better weaponry, SOLDIER operatives wasted no time heading to the open field and destroyed the bioterrorists. There were bodies everywhere.</p>
		<p id="content">
		At the middle of the battle, Almon retreated. He left his group to deal with SOLDIER. It didn't take long for Raz to notice this and took on the command of his brethren. Signaling the throwing of smoke grenades, high-explosives, terrorizing the area with poison, they entered a difficult battle. Since Raz had no experience to deal with minions and monsters alike, none of these minions and monsters took his commands seriously. They didn't have enough trust on him to obey his commands. That lead the defeat of their forces.</p>
		<p id="content">
		SOLDIER destroyed the renegade forces, except for Raz who is standing battered and exhausted. His brethren are killed, there's no more allies to help him fight the remaining operatives. As Raz looked from behind, he saw Jeffrey arrived along with Almon. SOLDIER operatives were surprised to see that Raz is fighting along with the renegades.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>You... Raz!? How could you?</i>" A SOLDIER operative was shocked by his betrayal. <br />
	"<i>You are behind this mutation? We thought we could trust you! I know you wouldn't do this! What a disgrace!</i>" Another SOLDIER operative expressing the same disgust. <br />
	"<i>I... lost myself. I didn't know I would end up like this. I killed the men at Glassheim that's why SOLDIER lost some men on refuge missions in such a haunted crypt like Glassheim. I took the pact that enabled me to be free. Free from stress, problems, and enemies. I have grown tired of how SOLDIER handled such innocent group like these monsters and bioterrorists alike. Poor creatures who are abused, longing to be free and exact revenge on those who gave them sufferings. You destroyed them, very pitiful. Since I know I'll be next in line, I shall make my final stand here.</i>" Raz saying his words with mercy.

		Jeffrey's face was painted with anger as he sees his forces destroyed. He grabbed a bow and arrow, equipped it with poison bolts, took a precise aim and fired at Raz. The poison bolts was not an ordinary poison to choke an individual to death but it is a special poison to nullify death and transforms the victim into an inhuman, a half-ghost, half-human. The poison hit Raz at his back. Raz drenched in pain and knelt in agony as small black wings started to appear at his spines. This gave him a somewhat invigorated power, a power that boosted morale and changed his emotions. A fumed and enraged Raz carefully glared at the shocked SOLDIER operatives who seemed to think nothing happened to him.</p>
		<p id="content">
		Raz immediately dashed with such force and tear each operatives with might. Raz didn't realize something had grown at his back. A seemingly shocked Jeffrey couldn't believe Raz would release such immense force, even Almon got surprised. SOLDIER had lost the rematch.</p>
