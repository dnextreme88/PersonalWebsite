<h2>Chapter 13: A Failed Defense</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Raz finally arrived at Ilang. Zeta Team has been holding their grounds as the massive forces of Jeffrey are pushing through. Raz gets an update from the team's leader, Serez.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Serez, what's going on here?</i>" Raz immediately asked Serez as he hurried up going to Ilang. <br />
	"<i>Raz, Jeffrey's forces advanced here coming from Route 382. We wouldn't imagine they'll be this massive!</i>" Serez surprised of Raz's appearance as he details about Jeffrey's invasion. <br />
	"<i>I knew they'll be coming here. I told Nicole to tell Biggs about this. We can't take this huge forces by ourselves. We need some assistance.</i>" Raz said he tries to call SOLDIER for backup. <br />
	"<i>Right. We thought we could be done for.</i>" Serez hesitantly affirms. <br />
	"<i>Jeffrey is after the pod we recovered some time ago. You know that when this happens, they'll be sending their best forces as possible.</i>" Raz reminded Serez. <br />
	"<i>They can't recover those pods! We'll be dealing with even more monsters! My men are patrolling them. They are kept safe in our warehouses.</i>" Serez said in a striking voice.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Serez's men are holding up their warehouses for they knew that Jeffrey is after the recovered pods. Out of the blue, Jeffrey stepped in from a distant cliff overseeing the city. He is accompanied by his elite forces.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>You have finally arrived, Raz. I knew you would come.</i>" Jeffrey announced as he looks at both SOLDIER leaders promptly. <br />
	"<i>I really did. You will pay for everything, Jeffrey!</i>" Raz shouted back. <br />
	"<i>It won't happen. You'll regret messing with me, again.</i>" Jeffrey nodded his head side-to-side. <br />
	"<i>It's nonsense! SOLDIER has come to destroy you, Jeffrey. Deal with it.</i>" Serez interrupts. <br />
	"<i>This village will be destroyed. Reclaiming our pods are my goals.</i>" Jeffrey said as he looks away from the city. <br />
	"<i>We will be here defending it and avoid you from getting it back. We are ready when you are.</i>" Serez ended with confidence.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		The showdown finally commenced. Raz attempted to thwart the advance of monsters through residential buildings. Serez simply waited for them to come near him before he could strike. He had enough battles with these monsters. SOLDIER was able to thin their numbers but fire was almost everywhere on every building. A catapult hurled a poisonous smoke that would turn affected operatives into bioterrorists. They were in for bigger trouble. Serez wasn't familiar with this kind of smoke so he had a different perception of this. Some of his men got affected and were turned into bioterrorists. Raz didn't hesitate to kill them while Serez seemed furious for killing his men.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Raz! You're killing my men! Don't do that!</i>" Serez shouted as both men were busy killing the monsters. <br />
	"<i>Calm down, Serez. Some of your men turned into bioterrorists. We had to kill them or we will be killed ourselves.</i>" Raz explained. <br />
	"<i>They're still my men! I can't lose my team here. SOLDIER is really thin on numbers.</i>" Serez stubbornly said. <br />
	"<i>I know. That's why we need to go after Jeffrey and end this once and for all!</i>" Raz explained once again with determination. <br />
	"<i>I don't think I'd do that after what you did. You should pay for your actions.</i>" Serez furiously said as he gets mad at Raz for killing his men. <br />
	"<i>What? Do you want to get killed or do you want to save your life? We did this and we had no choice. It's a do-or-die situation, Serez.</i>" Raz changed moods as he gets irritated by Serez.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		After a gruesome battle, a battered Jeffrey still made his remark. He crawls out. Though they seem to have failed their objective, they devised another plan to destroy the evidence.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>You... win again, SOLDIER. Great job. This... isn't the last time... we'll be battling. As long as I live, we... will continue to bring... doom on your cities.</i>" Jeffrey exclaimed exhaustedly. <br />
	"<i>We may have lost forces, but we are sure that we thwarted your attempts of recovering your pods. Our warehouses are well kept. You didn't get a chance to break it.</i>" Serez replied as if he never felt tired. <br />
	"<i>Don't be cocky, Serez. You'll know why.</i>" Jeffrey said as he slowly stood up.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		A bomb explosion was heard from a distance plus a smoke covering the warehouse. Patrolling guards were killed. What SOLDIER didn't know is that a spy made it onto the warehouse and recovered the pod. With that huge smoke, SOLDIER couldn't see it so they immediately rushed to the warehouse but the pod was gone.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Like... I said, this village... will be gone. Prepare for my last wave.</i>" Jeffrey remarked exhaustedly. <br />
	"<i>You won't do that!</i>" Raz replied as he ran as fast as he could.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Raz immediately used his wings to go after Jeffrey while he is being carried away from the village, using his wings too and flying slowly away from the village. They were surprised. Zeta Team tried to follow but they realized that a bomb will clear out the whole village. Serez told them to immediately retreat away from the village while Raz is in pursuit of Jeffrey. Because of not saving some villagers who seemed to be trapped and got killed, Serez frames Raz for the destruction of Ilang village. Raz still continued to follow Jeffrey and as he turns back, he saw the smoke that cleared the village. It was too late to go back.</p>
