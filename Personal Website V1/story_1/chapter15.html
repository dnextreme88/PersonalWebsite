<h2>Chapter 15: Fugitive On The Hunt</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Nicole contacted Raz on his whereabouts. There, they decided to meet up at the ruined Navang city. Raz flew up to that destination as Nicole's Beta Team waited patiently for his arrival. When he arrived, they sat on one of the ruined benches there and made another conversation. This could be the last time they'll be talking to each other.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Hi, Nicole. Good to see you again.</i>" Raz happily said seeing Nicole at a distance. <br />
	"<i>Hello, Raz. You should know something important. Biggs has ordered to eliminate you. SOLDIER is going after you on your pursuit on Jeffrey. You better escape.</i>" Nicole warns Raz of Biggs' plan. <br />
	"<i>How did that happen? Why would Biggs do that? I thought he could be trusted!</i>" Raz in surprise. <br />
	"<i>Well, things happened too fast. Serez framed you for the destruction of Ilang village.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
	"<i>What!? How dare he blame me for the loss! I guess I'm up to myself then. By the way, Nicole you should know that I am an inhuman.</i>" Raz said as he is shocked of SOLDIER's treatment of him. <br />
	"<i>I know about that. You were described. I was about to send some backup on Ilang if only we weren't attacked.</i>" Nicole clinched her fists. <br />
	"<i>I see. Who attacked you?</i>" Raz asked. <br />
	"<i>Jeffrey's forces. It was an ambush. Thankfully, we made it on one piece. We will help you vanquish Jeffrey, Raz.</i>" Nicole expressing her efforts to help Raz as she stood up. <br />
	"<i>No. You should stay. They'll think that you're helping a fugitive.</i>" Raz said as he let her sit again. <br />
	"<i>But Raz you'll need some help.</i>" Nicole insisted. <br />
	"<i>Don't worry, Nicole. I have my inhuman abilities to help me. You might get involved. I don't want you to get involved. I want you to be safe.</i>" Raz said expressing his concern over Nicole. <br />
	"<i>Be safe, Raz.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
	"<i>Before that, let me show you something.</i>" Raz said as he prepares to stand up.

		Raz then stood up and crouched. He revealed his black wings. He noticed his wings grew larger than before. Nicole looked on heavily on the wings. She never expected that wings could appear from a living human. Raz slowly turned back to Nicole.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>This black wings grew out of nowhere. I never realized my structure would mutate.</i>" Raz said as he shows his black wings to Nicole. <br />
	"<i>You fought too much bioterrorists. It's likely you got stung by their poison.</i>" Nicole remarked. <br />
	"<i>I believe so. Whatever it is, I must stand by my honor. That's the best legacy I could leave to myself.</i>" Raz said in a firm voice. <br />
	"<i>Right. You better get going, Raz.</i>" Nicole said. <br />
	"<i>Yes. I will leave my badge to you, Nicole. Keep it for you deserve it. Remember those times we are in missions together? I will cherish them. I don't know what awaits me.</i>" Raz giving his badge to Nicole while he sheds tears of his own. <br />
	"<i>Thank you, it meant a lot to me. That's very thoughtful of you, you're not like the others. Remember to fight for honor.</i>" Nicole bidding farewell to Raz. <br />
	"<i>I will. Farewell. Until next time.</i>" Raz bidding goodbye to Nicole once again.

		Nicole cried as he left. Raz flew to the skies freely as Beta Team looks on. They hope that he will be ok. Truly, it was hard for someone to be framed for something that he didn't intentionally do. Raz is now a fugitive, expelled from the beloved organization because of one mistake. The deceitful lie of his colleague caused it all. As the sun goes down, Beta Team also left the ruined Navang and headed home. They kept the short meeting between Raz and Nicole as a secret.</p>
