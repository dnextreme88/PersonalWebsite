<h2>Chapter 2: Village In Terror</h2>
		<p id="content">
		Both operatives were prepared and are set to go. They'll head to a small village nearby. It is being invaded by terrorists. Villagers immediately evacuate their places and ran as fast as they could to save themselves from the menacing terrorists. These terrorists are ruthless. They kill anyone on their path, no remorse, no mercy. It took the village by surprise to see invaders destroying their homes, killing people. Even when they're in deep trouble, some brave villagers still fought them off using anything at their surroundings at their disposal just to defeat their intruders. Some carry bats, others throw rocks, uses household tools such as shovel, hammer etc. Yet despite of their bravery, they are outmatched by the heavy weaponry of the terrorists.</p>
		<p id="content">
		In the midst of battle, SOLDIER was called up to solve the conflict in the village. 2 groups were dispatched to defend the village from being permanently wiped out as well as help the villagers fend them off. These were Alpha Team and Beta Team. Alpha Team is responsible for rescuing villagers out of the village. Beta Team was in-charge of dispatching the terrorists as soon as possible. As they arrive in the scene, it was a total wreck to see that nearly half of the village was wiped. Buildings were razed, people fighting each other, businesses are destroyed and loss of countless lives. A total mess, if you may say. There's no more lollygagging. It's about time that Alpha Team gets to rescue as many villagers as they can while Beta Team takes care of the invaders. Alpha Team then went on first, followed by Beta Team.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Alpha Team, go immediately at Route 331 and rescue the villagers that may be stuck there.</i>" Biggs issuing an order to Alpha Team over the walkie talkie. <br />
	"<i>Roger.</i>" Alpha Team affirms. They went to Route 331 as commanded. <br />
	"<i>Alpha Team is now proceeding to Route 331 at your orders, sir.</i>" Aaron said as Alpha Team rushes in. Meanwhile, Beta Team helped the villagers fight the terrorists.

		<p id="content">
		They charged through the front gates. Both teams then went on to their objectives. Alpha Team rescued the villagers that were stucked in the midst of battle and carried them to safety. When they managed to rescue all the villagers, they reported back to Biggs on the progress and gave out another order.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Sir, we have rescued all hostages on the area. We await your next orders.</i>" Aaron said as they accomplished their objective. <br />
	"<i>Good work out there, Alpha Team. Now proceed to Route 332 and neutralize the hostiles.</i>" Biggs issuing another order over the walkie talkie. <br />
	"<i>Roger that.</i>" Alpha Team followed. They followed Beta Team and helped in taking care of the terrorists.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		The terrorists seem to be gaining the upper hand. Beta Team fought back with the best they could and they managed to reduce the number of hostiles to half. Eventually, Biggs ordered Alpha Team to evacuate the area immediately along with the rescued hostages as Beta Team will take care of the rest. Raz commanded his team to search out for the abandoned buildings as terrorists might be hiding in those structures. A commotion ensued. The terrorists were losing and were eventually exterminated.</p>
		<div id="dialogues">
	"<i>Woohoo! We neutralized the terrorists!</i>" An excited operative exclaimed as they won over their opponents. <br />
	"<i>Good work, guys. I believe the terrorists are all neutralized. We should report back to HQ for progress.</i>" Raz said as they leave.
		</div>
		<p id="content">
		Indeed, it was a long battle that SOLDIER came out as victors. They all went to HQ. It's a long travel but they're bringing good news after that hard-fought battle that they worked hard in getting their victory. The good conquered over the bad.</p>
