<h2>Journal Entry #5</h2>
		<p id="content">Came back to class after yet another long weekend. So we get to meet another instructor today. Last week, we met our first instructor coming from the College of Arts & Science (CAS) department who specializes in the English division. Today, our second instructor comes from the "UC-LA". I even joked around, thinking that UC is in LA (Los Angeles), a state in America. But no, it actually stands for "University of the Cordilleras â€“ Legarda Annex". Seems legit.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Here's something good about him. He speaks French fluently. Very unique personality. Energetic and charismatic, he tries to make us awake with that energy and charisma he possessed. He even shared some French words such as "thank you very much", "hello", "good afternoon" etc. (although I forgot what the actual words were, they sounded really different).</p>
		
		<p id="content">So we had to present today the activity that was originally slated for Monday but there were no classes due to typhoon Labuyo's onslaught. It was by group and we had to name our groups. We named it after the typhoon. Then one representative from each group to read what he wrote for activity #1. In our group, I was chosen to be the representative. I was nagged by my best friend. Haha. Didn't have a choice. After the representatives read their activity #1 output, an open forum & feedback part was included. They had to give comments to each group. The comment given to me was "it was nice and straight to the point but it was so short. Overall, it was okay.". Afterwards, the instructors discussed on properly introducing oneself/someone then gave another activity regarding that. We have to make our self-introduction speech and present that next meeting. I doubt all of us will present anyway.</p>
