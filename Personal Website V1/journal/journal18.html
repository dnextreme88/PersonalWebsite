<h2>Journal Entry #18</h2>
		<p id="content">Happy Chinese New Year! Thankfully, I have recovered from my colds (maybe because it's a holiday?). Which means there's also no classes today! Last night, I received an inquiry on my Ecko Ultd. polo at around 11 PM and he will buy it on Friday, which is tomorrow. Today, I received an inquiry each for my Mossimo shirt, Dolce & Gabbana shirt and the Tender Juicy freebies. Now that's 3 customers (the 2 shirts were inquired by one person only). I'm finally selling my clothes!</p>
		
		<p id="content">First up: the Mossimo and Dolce & Gabbana shirts. We met up at our barangay's basketball court. He has a red, hatchback vehicle and I showed him my items. Then he asked me what else I'm selling so I ran back home, took out the 2 shirts, got all the clothes and went back to his car. Inside, he scanned each clothes and eventually decided to buy the 2 shirts earlier because he didn't like the colors of my other clothes. So I ran back and got the 2 shirts. He bought it for a whopping P500! Sweet!</p>
		
		<p id="content">After the transaction, I went to town to sell my Tender Juicy freebies. I waited for him at SLU, specifically at the nearby computer shops there since he was playing. Once I saw him, we made the transaction and ended fast. I obtained P70.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I went home and continued the day as normal. Next up: Ecko Ultd. polo tomorrow.</p>
