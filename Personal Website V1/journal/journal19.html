<h2>Journal Entry #19</h2>
		<p id="content">Midterm exams starts today. First up: Multimedia Systems. We took the exam on lecture period at our lab room in M307. There were still some who came late so they were given a -10 deduction to their exam score XD. I got 74/100. Not bad!</p>
		
		<p id="content">I went home to play 2 ranked games in LOL. I used Teemo and won those 2 matches with a record of 14-3 and 19-3. Afterwards, I reviewed Chapters 6 and 7 Exam answers on the internet (we won't be having the CCNA 2 exam today yet). I got out of the house and took my lunch at Bibac before my SAD class. Yeah, I'm amazed that sir only put 3 questions on the exam. The 3rd question was an application of what we learned (I hardly learned anything!). Anyway, I got 26/50 for the first 2 questions (the 3rd wasn't added yet). I did better than Prelims!</p>
		
		<p id="content">Nothing much for CCNA 2. Took the last 2 chapter exams for Midterms and went home. I paid P20 and received my change. When I got off the jeep, I realized I got the wrong change. At first I thought I got P13 (all one-peso coins) until I counted it and it totalled to P43.25! It was too late to give it back. My bad.</p>
		
		<p id="content">It was useless playing LOL after reaching home. The 7 games were all losses! Worst, they blamed me for feeding! At least I don't surrender from a match (I'm not a sissy to easily back down from a fight, unlike some players out there).</p>
