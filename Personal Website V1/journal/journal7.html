<h2>Journal Entry #7</h2>
		<p id="content">It's been 11 months since I wrote an entry here. Feels good to write again. Yesterday, there were no classes since it was Cordillera Day. I thought there would be classes today only to find out classes are suspended due to typhoon Glenda. I never stepped inside UC even. For most, it's good. As for me, it's not. I shouldn't stepped out of the jeep if I knew this would happen. A waste of jeepney fare. I decided to go home.</p>
		
		<p id="content">On my way, I saw my classmate Zedrick go to school. Ironic because he rarely attends classes and decided to attend when classes were suspended. Haha! I told him classes were suspended and he was very surprised. I convinced him to go and play at TNC in SLU since it was too early to go home. So we did and played League of Legends. Another frustration came in. There was a brownout mid-game. It's annoying, we were winning already. Everyone stepped out and we decided to eat at a nearby carinderia. I ordered... Pork Sisig! Yummy. Zedrick ordered a Thai-style chicken. Yeah, it was delicious too!</p>
		
		<p id="content">We decided to part way and went home. There was an electricity. Very ironic. This day was fooling me.</p>
