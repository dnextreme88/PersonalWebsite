<h2>Journal Entry #4</h2>
		<p id="content">No classes once again due to a strong typhoon called Labuyo. The typhoon has been a nuisance lately since its entry to the country, destroying agriculture, homes, lives and sources of income. That's a terrible thing about typhoons. We rejoice when there are no classes whereas others are unfortunate because they are victims of flash floods, land erosion and other similar calamities brought about by typhoons.</p>
