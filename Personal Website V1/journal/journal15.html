<h3>February 2, 2015</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #15</h2>
		<p id="content">Daddy arrived in the wee hours of Sunday, February 1st. I was still awake at 12 midnight yesterday but I wasn't able to witness his arrival. I knew it from Patrick since he was still awake that time (most of the time, he stays awake every midnight).</p>
		
		<p id="content">Today is the 3rd week of 3rd trimester SY 2014-2015. In Multimedia Systems lecture class, we're not even done with Chapter 1 yet. Exams will start in less than 3 weeks already haha! But were our discussions faster, we could have been in Chapter 2 by now. We are progressing in its lab class, finishing 3 activities (learning contract not included). In Systems Analysis and Design class, I hardly understand anything since we have to analyze a system, design it, maintain it for the company we selected (it's not fictitious, it's real!). Our Network Management is also fine. We're on our 2nd batch of lab activities, but on a turtle pace with the lectures.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I got home only to find out the screen door was locked. So I just texted my foreign friend about checking one of Tatay's vacant rooms. He came and said it was fine and he will inform me tomorrow about his decision. It's my 2nd time referring a possible transientee to Tatay. After eating, I finally got in! I asked Daddy why he locked the door and he said he was waiting for a doorbell. Damn, it was then that I realized that we have one! What a facepalm! Lesson learned? Utilize a doorbell to get in.</p>
