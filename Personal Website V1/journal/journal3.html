<h2>Journal Entry #3</h2>
		<p id="content">No classes today. It is the end of the Ramadan for our Muslim brothers and sisters. I guess that means the activity will continue by Monday. Woo! Nice one. Thank you. Much respect to these people. If we had classes today, I bet everyone would get bored. Haha. Luckily, we didn't have any.</p>
