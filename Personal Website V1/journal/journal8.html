<h2>Journal Entry #8</h2>
		<p id="content">A cold, rainy day surprises my Sunday morning. The planned jogging didn't push through. We were supposed to jog at 5:30 AM but we failed to wake up earlier. Me and Ate Kamille enjoyed the cold morning and decided to sleep more. I woke up at around 9 AM. Not the usual time I wake up. Haha!</p>
		
		<p id="content">This is my only day to review for Midterm exams starting tomorrow, Monday. Tomorrow's exam will be OOP 1 and Network Fundamentals. Laboratory and Lecture in one day. I fear my Network Fundamentals class. Questions will be arguably tougher than the Prelim exam. OOP 1's lecture is easy but the lab will be harder. Well, goodluck tomorrow then.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I texted Kaye and I said that we should have a date today. The plan is set in the afternoon. I wore my personally bought CM Punk's Best In The World (black) shirt, gray Tribal jeans bought by Daddy, a personally bought gray Vans sneakers and a pair of white Dickies socks. I went to Kaye's boarding house at Sandico St. (below Cathedral) only to find out she just woke up. I patiently waited for 30 minutes, just roaming around the parking area. Then I saw her coming out, she was sizzling hot! Happiness. Sadly, we fought at Vizco's (my first time to eat there) because I was laughing at her. It wasn't a negative joke but she deemed it negative. I won't say something that would hurt her. I just didn't realize she would take it seriously. She made me cry because she wouldn't hear my side, that she always must be right and I couldn't justify my own actions. By her request, she wants to be alone and I need to leave. When I got home, I cried really hard. Then I took a nap silently.</p>
