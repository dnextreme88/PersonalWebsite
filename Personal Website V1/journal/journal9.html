<h2>Journal Entry #9</h2>
		<p id="content">Today is Monday and marks the 10th week of the current trimester. Finally, we started our Finals lecture on OOP 1. A delayed meeting is precious enough to catch up with discussions since there's less than a month left and its the Final exams already. It's too fast!</p>
		
		<p id="content">I was supposed to see Kaye today but she didn't allow me since her "roommate" is there. I respect her privacy but I felt like she just doesn't want to see me today. Quite sad to know that I can't go to the boarding house. Then she asked me (via text) if I'm having a hard time with her, how my efforts go in vain and she doesn't reciprocate it, how the relationship affects my studies, how unfair that she doesn't give an attention to me, that she couldn't reply back to me and if I am already "tired". I asked her if she still loves me and she said "Kaw ba?". She didn't really answer it. When I said "Love you baby.", she replied "Ok.. sige kain ka na. Ingat.". I still have to ask about it so she would say she loves me too. From this point, I felt sad. Moreover, when I made it to Loakan terminal, I called her and she said they're in a taxi going to Loakan already. I told her to text me before she leaves. She probably just didn't care how I persevered waiting for her.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I decided to print 8 photos of me and Kaye. While I was waiting, tears ran down my face. I went home and immediately sat on the couch. Never before had I cried that emotionally when she can't say she loves me. I had to ask her before she can say it without being told to. One day, she would realize that even in my busy classes, I care, I pity and I love her no matter what happens. It truly pains me that she wouldn't talk to me the way she used to do before.</p>
