<h2>Journal Entry #1</h2>
		<p id="content">Today was the start of the so-called "Phase 2" of NSTP 1 that I never knew should happen. I heard from my classmates, friends, blockmates that there was no such "Phase 2" when they finished their NSTP 1 class. Well, it just so happens that we take this phase as a mandatory requirement to pass this subject.</p>
		
		<p id="content">There's no problem with the influx of Phase 2 for Finals. It focuses on improving one's reading, writing, speaking and listening skills through English. I get to write more often in school than at home to utilize this skill in the near future.</p>
