<h2>Journal Entry #23</h2>
		<p id="content">Today is a holiday: Labor Day. It's a day dedicated to employees to take a day off their office seats and relax for a while. I have scheduled this day to have my haircut since my hair is getting itchy. Afterwards, I went to SM to check the schedule of Avengers: Age of Ultron once again. Line is full so I didn't buy a ticket. QBox Station is my next destination. I purchased their card so I can use it every time I go there. The QBox Station card is worth P20 only.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I played there for the 1st time and my 1st game is WWE 2K15. The console on my station is XBox One, which is also my 1st time to use it. So lucky! My very 1st match on the game is HBK vs HHH on 2K Showcase Mode. I had a hard time beating HHH since I was alienated with XBox's controls. I had 3 attempts before giving up (I used most of my 1st 30 minutes just for 1 match). When my station turned off automatically (signifying my time is up), I extended for 1 hour. This time, I toyed around with my favorite mode of the series: WWE Universe Mode. P60 for 30 minutes and P120 for 1 hour seems expensive to me but playing one of my favorite video game series is worth it.</p>
		
		<p id="content">At home, Daddy, Tita Jhan, Lois and Patrick left for Manila at around 11 PM. I'm left home alone. I want to commute alone in going to Manila but an outing with Ate Kamille for a kart experience is better.</p>
