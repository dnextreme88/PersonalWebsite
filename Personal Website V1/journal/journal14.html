<h3>January 12, 2015</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #14</h2>
		<p id="content">It's a Monday morning today. The 1st day of enrollment for 3rd trimester SY 2014-2015 starts today. CAS, CCJE, CITCS and CCJE will start first. The schedule for CITCS is 3rd years (AM) and 2nd years (PM). Tomorrow are all 1st year students and on Wednesday, all year levels (plus transferees and shifters). Using the new plain black bag that Daddy bought, I set out to school. I grabbed my grades first and I was surprised. I passed Accounting Essentials! It was so unexpected! I'm extremely happy but Jhon, Kendrick and Reyn failed. Jhon failed all his subjects except for OOP 2 and PE 3. Probably Kendrick failed his other subjects too and Reyn is taking up the 3rd trimester subjects tomorrow (she'll come back tomorrow). I'm officially 2nd year and I think I won't be classmates with them for some time.</p>
		
		<p id="content">After enrolling, me and Kendrick had our haircuts. Then we went to Lemonet to play 2 games of LOL. We lost the 1st game but managed to win on the 2nd game.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I went home pretty late that they already ate for dinner. Then I realized that Daddy already left after 10 days of staying here. Another time.</p>
