<h3>February 7, 2015</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #17</h2>
		<p id="content">Yes, it's Saturday! Time is so fast! It doesn't feel like 2015 at all haha! Anyway, I stayed at the library to wait for my IT Presentation Skills class. For some reason, I couldn't think of what to write for over an hour of stay there. So I took a nap instead since I was still sleepy.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Prior going to school, I was at town by 7:39 AM to wait for the person who's going to buy my Tribal Camo shirt for P250. Although he never came, I was in at a surprise. The Session Road was closed due to CARAA, where schools from different places of CAR walk from Upper Session Road going to Baguio Athletic Bowl. I was at Porta Vaga and I just finished watching all the delegates before I went to UC. Despite not being able to sell my item, it was worth my time at Session Road.</p>
		
		<p id="content">At 10:20 AM, we waited for Ma'am Kwo. When 15 minutes has passed, we already had an attendance paper to sign since she has not showed up for class. I still have another chance to do my assignment! So Zel and Ric wants to have lunch again so they told us about it and we agreed. This time, Kuya Wilson and Jules joined us.</p>
		
		<p id="content">We went to SM Baguio to stroll a bit and decided to eat at KFC. Zel and Ric ordered the Bucket Meal which has exactly 6 chickens for the 6 of us. Just like the Andok's 2 days ago, we took a lot of selfies (some were stolen shots) using Kevin's phone again. After eating, me, Kevin, Kuya Wilson and Jules went back to UC while Zel and Ric went home. Add this day to one of my happy days!</p>
