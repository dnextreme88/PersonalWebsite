<h2>Journal Entry #10</h2>
		<p id="content">Woke up at around 4:12 AM. Had around a 6-hr sleep. I scheduled this day for my jogging since I need to be innovative and creative during my 3 weeks of semestral break. Heated my water, took a bath, dressed up, had wax, prepared the items to bring (wallet, face towel, cellphone, perfume, water) and placed them in a Reebok bag that Ate Kamille lent me temporarily.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Time check at 5:26 AM. Got the house keys and carried my bag. Ooohh, it's not a cold morning (when it's supposed to be). I hardly feel anything on my Kevin Garnett Adidas shoes. Anyway, I made it to Burnham and had a warm-up by the Children's Park going to the Biking Area and to the Lake, at last. I was there just in time for 6 AM (the bell from City Hall rang) and jogged around the Lake for 9 laps. That beats my July 29 record with only 8 1/2 laps. Black shoes are better than white ones haha.</p>
		
		<p id="content">After jogging, I went to TNC only to find out it was closed. Well, I can't play today haha. Despite that, I enjoyed so much.</p>
