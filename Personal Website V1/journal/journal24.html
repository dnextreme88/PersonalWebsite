<h2>Journal Entry #24</h2>
		<p id="content">We made it to Ate Kamille's house here in Pampanga last night. Before that, we rode a van designated for Dagupan to check on Ate Collen and along with their friend, we had a spectacular view of the seaside somewhere in Bonuan. Then me and Ate Kamille headed for Tarlac to have the long-planned karting. Sadly, it rained hard and karting is unavailable due to the wet tracks. Well, that sucks. So we just went to Pampanga.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I've never been here ever. Before heading to their house, Ate Kamille showed me where "The Walking Street" is. At least now I know why there are a lot of foreigners in here. Hahaha! Then she showed me where the original Sisig was made. It's an ordinary carinderia owned by "Aling Lucing", who invented the legendary Sisig meal. Sadly, she passed away. The store is just a few blocks from Ate Kamille's house (they also own a sari-sari store).</p>
		
		<p id="content">We woke up in time for lunch. It's not that hot here in Pampanga thankfully. We went to Robinsons Angeles to play at Tom's World. It's like Quantum but tokens cost P4 instead of P6. Ate Kamille nearly lost her phone inside the premises. We were asking around if they found a phone. I still had to text Ate Collen to inform her about it and before I could send the message, an honest kid in green shirt approached her and handed the phone. It fell on the seat she was at. She said she nearly had a "heart attack" because she felt so scared on what transpired. She thanked his dad and his siblings for having such an honest son. She bought tokens to give it to the kid but sadly, they left.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Ate Kamille still have 2 tokens left. We transferred to the other Tom's World of the mall. There were more people out there. We played ice hockey. I lost to her at the score of 1-2. Afterwards, we went home as our next stop is on the gym.</p>
		
		<p id="content">The gym is Shoulders & Boulders. The walk-in fee is P35 but only paid P20 (Ate Kamille shouldered the P15 so she would pay P50 instead). Cardio exercise for 15-25 minutes then strength exercises and lastly, ab exercises before leaving. I felt some "gym rust" since it's been awhile I get to use the equipments.</p>
		
		<p id="content">The Pampanga escapade, as I call it, didn't stop there. We took a short rest at home then went to SM Clark. I get to watch Avengers: Age of Ultron finally! The best scene was when Ultron's army attacked the Avengers. They're just on an empty ruin fending themselves. After watching, we rode a jeep going to Didi's Pizza. We ordered the Combination Pizza, where cheese, salami, mushroom, pepperoni and sausage toppings are all in 1 pizza. So delicious! Our last stop is at a bar just across the street. Inside, the place is so beautiful! There was a live band, who is on their last set. The girls wore super shorts and their legs whiter than the searchlight. Hahaha!</p>
		
		<p id="content">Finally, we went home. We're going back to Baguio tomorrow as well. The karting will probably happen soon. We're just unlucky that the bad weather occurred on the day of the outing.</p>
