<h2>Journal Entry #12</h2>
		<p id="content">Kamile invited me to go out for a party at Spade Superclub a couple of days ago. I wore a plain black V-neck shirt, a Wall Street brown windbreaker, a Cotton Crews brown pants and the Converse sneakers. Also included is an undercut hairstyle, waxed by Bench. This is going to be a cold, cold night!</p>
		
		<p id="content">I arrived at Spade before 10 PM. I thought I was late since the agreement was 9:30 PM but it was exactly the opposite - I was early! I waited for around 40 minutes and they finally arrived. This is the 3rd time I've been to Spade with her. March 29 was the first one, which was a CEA Night. August 20 was the second one, which was her 20th birthday and VIP inclusion.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Once inside, we ordered the first 2 buckets of San Mig Light worth P119 each - my treat but I assure them they'll pay the succeeding buckets because they didn't bother sharing their payment. Why go to a bar if you can't have your share for the beers?</p>
		
		<p id="content">Ange volunteered to pay for the 3rd bucket and asked me to bring it to our tables. I had to traverse the crowded space with ease since I was holding the bucket. Then some of Kamile's friends asked her if I'm her boyfriend (how I'd wish!). I said no since I heard them. This is one of the best moments of my night.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Two more of her friends came in. They're sisters! I socialized with one of them. Her name is Daphne. She wore a red cocktail dress, has semi-long hair and brought with her a small purse. At first, I thought she's sexy but as I gradually remember her face, she's not that sexy. Two foreigners came to our table. One of them is dancing with her. Then Daphne approached me and said she doesn't like it. So she talked to that foreigner and told him I'm her boyfriend before telling it to me. It was her way to stop that guy from dancing with her. I just reluctantly agreed so I deemed her my "girlfriend of the night". It was just temporary! Haha. Another best moment of the night.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Ange then talked to me and asked if we would order a vodka (because the others aren't giving their share) or order another bucket instead. We went for Jose Cuervo (it was the cheapest one in the menu) and finally, the others gave their share. Kamile and Dave left during this time. Two of their friends left shortly afterwards. By this time, I socialized with one of the girls that was left behind.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Her name is Krizia. She used to be Kamile's classmate but transferred to UB taking up HRM. She asked me to keep the guy behind her at bay because she doesn't know him and he's not even part of our group. I convinced that person and he slowly went away. Good boy. We left Spade at around 4 AM. Daphne and her sister went home. This leaves 5 of us remaining. We walked going to the convenience store in Petron for relaxing since we got deaf due to the prolonged stay inside Spade. Ange was also drunk and was dancing dirty to me. It's a secret to not tell it to anyone we both know. I treated Krizia the Sola drink. We sat by the wooden bench and chatted until Ange, Mike (Ange's bestfriend) and one of Kamile's batchmate left. This leaves me and Krizia.</p>
		
		<p id="content">We didn't want to go home yet so we decided to chat in Rose Garden until sunlight. We got there by 5 AM. She has a crush on me! While chatting, I'm so clingy and romantic to her (like holding her hands, wrapping my arms on her shoulder) as if she's my girlfriend. She's kind, funny and cute. At 6 AM, I hailed a cab for her and got her number (09174298800). Last best moment of the night. This is my best day for 2014!</p>
