<h2>Journal Entry #2</h2>
		<p id="content">Here is another day in my NSTP 1 class. Honestly, I felt a weird vigor in me that my assignment (to be passed later on) is wrong because I pasted the picture immediately at my journal (seen on the previous page) when I'm supposed to just bring the picture instead. That's what I thought until the class started wherein our instructor asked who did the assignment.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Then he asked those who didn't do the assignment. Luckily, I was able to accomplish it in the wee hours of the morning. Hard to look for the picture you need due to tiredness,boredom and that urge to sleep and forget about the assignment. However, that wasn't the case. I had to fight that sleepiness and accomplish the assignment before going to bed. So I did. Found a newspaper with a lot of pictures of gadgets, technologies etc. and made haste in cutting that newspaper to nab the picture I need.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I pity those who didn't do the assignment. One by one, they were asked to explain why. Some were forgiven while the others had more explaining to do. Standing up in the stage explaining something to save your face and be given consideration seems hard for those students. Well at least those who were given a chance gets to do the assignment.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Our instructor then revealed what we are going to do with the pasted picture. We had to give a description about it. Seems easy? Somewhat. We had to use 2 paragraphs minimum to fulfill the task. That's quite absurd since I prefer just giving it a very simple, yet short description and "direct to the point" rather than an extensive, yet long description that doesn't get to the point of what you're trying to imply. I did it with as less sentences as possible yet concise.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Afterwards, we had to select a partner who'll be asking questions regarding the description we wrote. This is to prepare for Q & A portions that our instructor will do when activities like this is given, in which he himself told the class awhile ago. Then my partner has to sign it as proof that she was my partner for this activity.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Next meeting, students will be randomly called and read the description he/she wrote. The Q & A portion comes afterward. The instructor will ask questions based on the description the student read.</p>
