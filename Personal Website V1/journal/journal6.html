<h2>Journal Entry #6</h2>
		<p id="content">So we had to present our outputs today. Yes, I was right. The instructors couldn't accommodate the time for all of us to present so they decided once again to have representatives from each group to represent their groups and deliver the output. Good idea. One group presented a duo conversation, the other a "new acquiantance" conversation and the last a duo conversation as well. Our group's representatives, however, presented a group conversation. There were a lot of them, luckily sir said it was fine.</p>
		
		<p id="content">After the presentations, our English instructor discussed UC's Core Values. I don't know why they give too much importance on that. Those are the things I see on bulletin boards all over the campus. They are self-explanatory, in my opinion.</p>
		
		<p id="content">After her discussion, another activity took place. We had to give phrases we like about UC, phrases we don't like about UC and phrases that UC can improve on. Not only that we need to use 15 nouns, verbs and adverbs, 10 adjectives, 20 prepositions and conjunctions. After that, using those phrases, we must construct an essay about UC. That's a hassle. We only had 30 minutes to do that but thankfully it was by group of 3's. We were the second-to-the-last group to pass. It was hard. I did the essay writing while my 2 groupmates formed the phrases. Thank God that was over!</p>
