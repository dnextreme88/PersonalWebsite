<h3>January 8, 2015</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #13</h2>
		<p id="content">We're 8 days removed from 2014. Everyone has had their ups and downs. I shared my own experience of the past year filled with lots of twists. A great year has passed.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Since December 29 last year (where me and Noel watched "The Amazing Praybeyt Benjamin" while Lola and Megan watched "Feng Shui" in SM), this is the 1st day of 2015 that I get to go outdoors. I've been strained at home for over a week because I focused on cleaning the house (especially the windows).</p>
		
		<p id="content">At around 6:30 AM, I made it to Burnham Lake to jog for 8 laps. There were only a few joggers in the area, which made it easier for me to traverse around. After jogging, I bought 2 Powerade drinks at 7-11 to quench my thirst and sweat. It was fun. I rode a jeep going home afterwards. I played LOL until 2 PM where I will head to my next venture.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I wore my dark blue shorts for the first time (I bought it at the night market last year with Ate Kamille and Ate Collen) and my doll socks as well. Kamile is already in SM and I'm still at the jeep. When I got there, she asked me where would she treat me for lunch. I gave her 5 choices: The Old Spaghetti House, Sizzling Plate, McDo, KFC and Pizza Hut. We agreed on KFC. Afterwards, I accompanied her in Watsons and in the foodcourt (she bought a new SUN sim). Then we went to Starbucks in Session Road and it's my turn to treat her. We both ordered the Christmas Cookie frappucinno, had a long convo and parted ways.</p>
