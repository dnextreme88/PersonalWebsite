<h2>Journal Entry #21</h2>
		<p id="content">Today is the 2nd day of the Final exams. Just like the previous trimesters, the Finals exams schedule is a mess. Tomorrow is Friday and it is schedules as a TThS day. This means that we have a regular class meeting on TThS subjects. We took our IT Presentation Skills exam today though. I got 34/62</p>
		
		<p id="content">Our Systems Analysis and Design presentation is scheduled at 2:35 PM. I sacrificed my CCNA 2 lab class just so we can end this S-A-D agony once and for all. Sir Dilan asked questions and among his feedbacks, the DFDs still had a lot of violations. That's what I should really improve on. I saw my grades at Sir Dilan's laptop. Surprisingly, I passed! He graded our presentation. My grades were 73-74-77, in order. Ironically, Ric passed but Christian failed. I was surprised because I was expecting he would pass but he didn't. Seriously though, I nearly cried when I knew I passed! This awesome feeling!</p>
		
		<p id="content">To get this weird excitement off my chest, I played LOL at Lemonet. 1 ranked duo game each with Reyn and Kuya Alfie with a lose and won match, respectively. After that, I went home and played Dying Light in the PS4. It's my 3rd day of playing it because I enjoyed this fantastic zombie-survival game so much! Daddy made an excellent suggestion, no doubt.</p>
