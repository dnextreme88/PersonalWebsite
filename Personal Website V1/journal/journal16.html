<h2>Journal Entry #16</h2>
		<p id="content">A cold Thursday breeze greets me in the morning. Despite that, I wore my blue Cowboys polo and headed off to school at 9:18 AM. I went to the library and spent my time thinking and writing the idioms I'm very familiar. I used my phone to connect to the school's Wi-Fi and managed to get in. Even if the webpage takes around 2 minutes to load, it was fine because I was able to get some idioms on the internet. At 10:20 AM, I left the library and headed off to my 1st class of the day: IT Presentation Skills.</p>
		
		<p id="content">We had a quiz on Technical Writing, including a spelling portion of 5 random words: insidious, magnanimous, quagmire, veracity and wag. I got them all correct except for the last one, where I spelled it as "whag". I got a borderline score of 15/30 which was originally 14/30 due to a miscount. Luckily, I counted it off to double-check my score. I passed! After the class, me, Zel, Ric and Kevin decided to eat lunch together.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Ma'am Kwo dismissed us immediately after the quiz since she has to attend a conference. We accompanied Zel on BPI first so she can withdraw money. Then we discussed on where we'll eat. We agreed on Andok's. From there, we all ordered the Porkcharap meal. Kevin treated the 1.5 L Coke, Zel treated the Mais Con Yelo and I treated the extra rice of 5. I spent P110 and it was worth it. We had a long, fun and exhilarating conversation together. The topics ranged from our past relationships, history of Facebook, UC's enrollment system and more.</p>
		
		<p id="content">I was so happy this day. How I'd wish this happens again. A simple friends' hangout can make an ordinary day so special! Hopefully, Zel will upload the selfies we took on Kevin's phone.</p>
