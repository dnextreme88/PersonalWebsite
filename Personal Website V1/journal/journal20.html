<h2>Journal Entry #20</h2>
		<p id="content">Finally, it's Friday! Time flies so fast that in the next 2 weeks, it'll be April. I woke up late today, missing my Multimedia Systems lab class at 8:55 AM. To curb that up, I finished my Systems Analysis and Design project instead before we pass it later in class at 2:35 PM. It was actually rushed since I lacked time (plus I did most of the project paper's content). Groupmates aren't cooperative enough. Besides, I need to pass whatever we finished since I'm on the brink of failing Systems Analysis and Design (no wonder it has an acronym of SAD).</p>
		
		<p id="content">I went to Lemonet to play LOL (got nagged by Reyn haha!). I didn't make a bad choice after all. We won 5 consecutive ranked games! Because of that, I made it in the promotion series. She finished her series and was promoted to Silver II. Out of the blue, Kamile texted me if I want to join them at The Ampersand later in the evening. Without hesitation, I agreed (besides I'm still in town and haven't went home yet). Then I left Lemonet.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Kamile told me to head to Zola and chill for awhile. They were seated at the middle. Kamile was wearing that Cara Delevigne shirt that I gave her last Christmas. Ange was here too. They had 2 bottles of San Mig Light, sharing the drinks together. After awhile, we headed to The Ampersand to meet Kamile's older sister and their friend. I paid for our taxi fare and in turn, she treated me our entrance fee. Now that's fair and square! We deposited our bags to the storage clerk before heading upstairs to The Ampersand.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Inside, there were still few people around. We're actually too early! We had 3 different cocktail towers for the 10 of us, varying in colors of orange, blue and white XD. I only knew Kamile, Ange and Mike personally (Kamile's older sister, Ate Karissa, and I are only mere acquaintances). All the rest are strangers to me.</p>
		
		<p id="content">On our 4th cocktail round (blue-colored cocktail on its 2nd round and the other 2 still on their 1st round), I've been noticing that Kamile is going to the CR a couple of times (5 times since we entered). So I began to worry and asked her friends on her whereabouts. They said they don't know. Then I received a text from her that reads "Di kug bs kya dto kuh tablr lpit cr". Oh, she's drunk! I immediately headed out and found her sitting (in a bent position) by the VIP bench closest to the CR. I comforted her and she handed her Iphone to me and puked on the black carpet. It was the 1st time I saw her really drunk.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Ange found us both and told me to grab our bags already. I offered to carry Kamile but Ange refused. I got our bags and as I turned around, Ate Karissa and her chubby friend showed up (they were also MIA too). We let Kamile relax before I hailed a cab for them. To my surprise, I realized I forgot to give her phone back. Me and Mike were the only ones left. He said he knows where she lives, not too far from The Camp. We decided to walk it up.</p>
		
		<p id="content">She lives at St. Joseph Village (the opposite intersection going to Berkeley school). They have a bungalow-type house. Once there, we waited for around 30 minutes for Ange to come out. Then we gave the phone and left the premises. I took note of their house number: #18 or #22 (I don't know which because they're both placed on the gate). Tomorrow is CEA Night! XD</p>
