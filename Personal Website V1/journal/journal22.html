<h3>April 24, 2015</h3>
<h2>Journal Entry #22</h2>
		<p id="content">It's the last Friday of the month. I decided to go out to SM and check the schedule for Avengers: Age of Ultron. I texted Kendrick and Kamile to invite them to watch the movie with me. Neither one replied. After checking the schedule, I realized all cinemas (except Cinema 4, it was Fast and Furious 7 movie being shown in there) were showing Avengers: Age of Ultron. It was just released a couple of days ago.</p>
		
		<p id="content">It's nearly 2 PM and I need to eat. So I ate at Sawrapped nearby. I ordered one of my favorite meals: Sisig! My order also included a regular iced tea and 2 extra rice. So delicious! The order amounted to P346 but it's worth it anyway.</p>
		
		<p id="content">Afterwards, Norina texted me to go out drinking with her at Singgles Bar. At first, I didn't know where it is. Then she described it where. It's located at Lower Session Road, beside Yellow Cab. I thought she's already there, so I hurriedly walked down Session Road. When I got to the destination, I realized she's still on her way there (I'm always early). By 3:24 PM, she finally arrived! Last time we drank together was on December 6, 2013. Been a long time!</p>
		
		<p id="content">She went up first. When I saw the bar's entrance, I was able to remember a time where she invited me here before. I realized it's the 2nd time she invited me here. She decided that we sit at the counter. She ordered 2 Blue Lagoon cocktails worth P180 each, Chicken Fillet worth P130 and I ordered 2 Red Horse Stallion beers (which was eventually cancelled). Then we started the conversation (we had not went out drinking for a long time) as we drink the cocktail. I sang "Upside Down", "Kung Kailangan Mo Ako", "Untitled" and "When You Say Nothing At All". Norina sang "Hanggang Ngayon" and "How To Love".</p>
		
		<p id="content">We finished the Blue Lagoon cocktails and she ordered a case of Emperador Lights (the replacement for the Red Horse beers). During the conversation, she saw a small cockroach on the Chicken Fillet and reported it to one of the ladies in the bar. They got that plate and gave our bill as well. To my surprise, she treated our drinks (I thought she totally forgot about it since December 6, 2013). We were asked to transfer to a table because the lady feared the cockroach will come back haha! They gave another Chicken Fillet as a replacement to the 1st one (no additional charges yey!).</p>
		
		<p id="content">Then came Karla, Norina's friend. The bulk of our conversations was really about Norina's boyfriend. Surprisingly, her boyfriend followed us there. This is already the signal that we needed to go because her boyfriend is "jealous" of me, according to Norina. I don't know what is to be jealous about haha! So we parted ways. Me and Karla headed up north while the 2 of them hailed a cab there at Yellow Cab. My convos with Norina will truly be unforgettable, as well as the moment spent.</p>
