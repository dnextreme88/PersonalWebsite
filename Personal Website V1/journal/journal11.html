<h2>Journal Entry #11</h2>
		<p id="content">A cold breeze greets my Thursday morning. I was able to prepare and eat breakfast in less than an hour since I'm rushing to my 7:30 class (Applied Data Structures). The jeep filled up so fast, expecting to arrive in UC in time. I realized I was too early because Ma'am Cruz isn't around yet. As expected, Ricky, Kendrick and Jhon didn't attend class again. Paul came around 8:30 AM, 25 minutes before the time. At least he still bothered to enter class. But it was vice-versa for Communication in the Workplace: Paul was absent and the 3 friends were present. So ironic.</p>
		
		<p id="content">After my Communication in the Workplace class, I waited for Ate Kamille and Ate Collen at 4:30 PM. We took a jeepney ride going to SLU (Ate Kamille and Ate Collen reminisces their tenure in SLU) and ate at Macsbox. I tried the Porky Pick rice and went for another round this time, ordered Crab Sticks rice. Delicious!</p>
		
		<p id="content">We went home then I ate Sopas, to make it up to Tita Vina who was expecting me since 4 PM (I wasn't able to text her). Again, I exclaimed inside my head "Delicious!". It is worth eating for. Mama called to ask how everything is going on the house. I said our woes with Patrick such as disrespecting our relatives, not eating meals on time, hard to call and the worst of them all, not attending classes. Oh for Pete's sake, Daddy should fund his schooling (personal needs too) when Patrick studies in Manila. He's a pain in the ass! I always get concerns from Tatay and Tita Vina about his laziness. I'm already ashamed of answering their questions everytime they open it. Damn, my life is full of lies and problems!</p>
