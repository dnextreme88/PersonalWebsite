			<p>My favorite pasttime is playing video games. Back when I was 8 years old, I've been an avid gamer ever since. I own a PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 console systems. For handhelds, I own a PSP, GameBoy Advance SP and a Nintendo DS. I am a pro-Sony guy and I don't favor Microsoft when it comes to video game systems hehe. 
			
			<p>My favorite video game series are Final Fantasy, Resident Evil and WWE. Final Fantasy is such a compelling, addictive RPG (Role Playing Games) that is full of adventures. It's the reason why I have grown to like RPG. Resident Evil is an action-horror video game that isn't that even scary. Silent Hill is a lot scarier than Resident Evil. It revolves on the main protagonist(s) quest to solve the mysteries behind the story. Lastly, WWE games are a simulation to its show counterpart. You get to play as the wrestlers seen on TV and just simply beat up other wrestlers as you see fit. People complain of its outdated roster and lack of improvements as WWE games are made every year. Yet, it's one of those game series that people anticipate for because they expect an updated roster and new features to be added as well as remove redundant features seen on past installments of the series.</p>
			
			<p>Playing video games is not only my form of recreation. It's not my entire life to spend my time on. I do watch movies from time to time. My favorite movie genres would be action, suspense or movies with an innovative plot. Recently, I watched Insurgent, which was a sequel to last year's Divergent and it was so good. Well, in my opinion. Also from last year is Edge of Tomorrow, where the plot was that whenever the protagonist die, they would go back in time and as long as the mechanism hasn't been destroyed, the war will keep replaying as if it never ends. Another movie would be Final Fantasy: Advent Children in 2005. My favorite movie would be Goldmember, where it starred John Meyers and Beyonce back in 2002. </p>
			
			<p>As for TV series, my favorite would be CSI and WWE. I watch CSI with my mom back then. Crime scenes in CSI really intrigue me that's why I grew my fondness for it. The latter is my childhood favorite. My favorite TV show is The Big Bang Theory. Sadly, I don't get to watch it everyday anymore. That show is just really packed with sensible humor.</p>

			<p>"I'll Be Missing You" by Diddy Ft. Faith Evans is my favorite song. It's a 1997 song dedicated to a famous rapper that died on the same year. My favorite music genres are 90's hip-hop such as my favorite song, R&B, house and rock. I'm not a music aficionado of some sort, music keeps us relaxed as we go through our daily struggles in life.  I hate genres that makes me sleepy or way too emotional such as country or acoustic and songs that keeps playing on radios like "Buko" and "All Of Me".</p>
			
			<p>I used to play pianos before. Lately, I forgot how to play such due to its scarcity in society. I was playing the piano back when I was 7 years old. Talk about reminiscing moments.</p>

			<figcaption>Crossword puzzles are just as entertaining as it can be.</figcaption>
		
			<p>In a rare occurence, I play crossword puzzles on my spare time too. They're a lot harder since it requires knowledge of cities, histories, words, synonyms and one of the things I absolutely hate: actors/actresses. I like playing Chess too but I only play online since most people stay away from logic games such as these two. They prefer sitting and sending SMS to friends and peers without sense or they'll find it boring.</p>
			
			<p>Above all these, I love writing poems. I'm amazed by rhyming words with other words that's why I got the hang of it. Because of the hectic schedule, I don't always get to do this. Yet, it feels good and I make the best of my time when I write. You can check out some of it on the poems page.</p>
			
			<p>From time to time, I jog. My destination is usually at Burnham Park because it's very cool and because there are other people who does exercise as well. I travel through the Rose Garden then circle the Lake. I jog around for an hour. Waking up early is a big plus, so I could feel the cold breeze as I jog. Another interest is that I like a clean area. So basically, I hate a filthy area so everytime I think my area is dirty, I would pick up dirt and clean it. Well, only on my area.</p>
