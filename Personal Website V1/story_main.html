A quiet and persevering man, the story follows his journey in his conquest to rid of the renegade group headed by former SOLDIER operative, Jeffrey. Jeffrey had gathered a large upscale forces that have terrorized the lands of Thalts.</p>

		<p>SOLDIER (Special Operating Law Defensive Investigators Executing Renegades) is a secret task force whose main goal is to eliminate inhumanity in the land. SOLDIER is headed by Biggs, whose skills in the military and fervent training in battlegrounds made him a powerful yet kind-hearted leader. SOLDIER operates privately and does not take orders from the government. They have no working relationship from other private agencies by the government either. Recruitment is voluntary and is usually through invites only. SOLDIER is composed of many groups. These groups are utilized in special missions when trouble is present.</p>
